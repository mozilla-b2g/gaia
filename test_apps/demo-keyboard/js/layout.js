/*
 * A KeyboardLayout object represnts a single localization of the keyboard
 * app. In general each language will have its own KeyboardLayout object.
 * There may also be more than one layout for a given language. The Dvorak
 * layout and QWERTY layouts might both be used for English, for example.
 *
 * A KeyboardLayout may have more than one "page". The default page generally
 * displays letters and alternate pages may display numbers, punctuation,
 * symbols, etc.
 *
 * Each page has a default layout, but may also define variant layouts
 * that depend on the type attribute of the input field that the user is
 * entering text into. For example the "email" variant of a page layout
 * might include an @ character that is not present for normal type="text"
 * input.
 *
 * The layout of a page is specifed as an array of strings. Each
 * element of the array represents one row of the keyboard (from top to
 * bottom). Each string is a space-separated list of key names.
 *
 * Keys are defined separately from the page layouts. Each page of a
 * keyboard layout defines a mapping from key names to key objects.
 * A key object has these properties:
 *
 *   name: the name of the key
 *   keycap: the string of text displayed on the key
 *   keycmd: a string specifying the command sent by the key
 *
 * Depending on the command, a key may have other properties. The "sendkey"
 * command has an associated keycode property, for example, and the "switchpage"
 * command has a "page" property.
 *
 * The properties of a key object may be explicitly specified in the
 * KeyboardLayout configuration file, as part of the keys property of
 * the page or of the containing layout. If properties are not
 * specified, they are derived from the key name.  If no keycap is
 * specified, then the name is used as the key cap. If the name has a
 * single character and no keycmd is specified, then keycmd defaults to
 * "sendkey" and the name is used as the keycode.
 *
 * This class includes some page layouts and key definitions that may
 * be generally useful for a variety of locales.  If a configuration
 * file includes a string where a page definition object was
 * expected, the string will be used to look up a pre-defined page.
 * If a layout includes a keyname that is not defined elsewhere, it
 * will be looked up in the set of predefined keys. As a convention,
 * predefined pages and keys have names that are all uppercase.
 *
 * This module is supposed to be general enough that it can move
 * to shared/js/keyboard/layout.js for use by multiple keybaord apps.
