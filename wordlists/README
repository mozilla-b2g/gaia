This directory contains wordlists and a script used to create the
binary dictionary files used by the auto-correct feature of the Gaia
virtual keyboard.

The words2dict script is a Python program that generates a dictionary
file from a word list. To regenerate all dictionaries, just type
'make'.  To create a single dictionary use the dictionary name as the
make target:

  make fr.dict  # create a French dictionary.

The dictionary files are created in this directory. After creating
them, you must copy them manually into
../apps/keyboard/js/imes/latin/dictionaries so that the keyboard can
use them.

The files in the android/ directory are open-source word lists from
Android. They were taken from the master branch of the
platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME repository available at
https://android.googlesource.com/
