# This file provides localization strings for the Language Pack.

###
# LOCALIZATION NOTE: The name of the language pack and its description 
# will be displayed to the user when browsing the list of language packs
# on the marketplace and during installation.
#
# IMPORTANT: these strings need to be adapted to your language, not simply 
# translated. "English (US)" needs to be replaced with the localized version 
# of your language name: "Italiano" for Italian, "Polski" for Polish, etc. 
# 
# If the region is relevant for your locale, add it (e.g. "English (US)").
# Otherwise drop the " (US)".
# 
#
# brandShortName will be taken from shared/locales/branding/
