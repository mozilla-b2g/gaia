# LOCALIZATION NOTE
# For each permission there are three strings:
#
#   * the permission name, displayed in the Settings app
#   *-appRequest = displayed in a dialog box when an app requires a permission
#   *-webRequest = displayed in a dialog box when a web site requires a permission
#
# The two latter strings are identical in English but might require a more
# specific phrasing in your locale. Note that permission dialogs will display
# two buttons: “Allow” and “Deny”.
