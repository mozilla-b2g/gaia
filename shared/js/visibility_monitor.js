/* exported monitorChildVisibility */
/*
 * visibility_monitor.js
 *
 * Given a scrolling container element (with overflow-y: scroll set,
 * e.g.), monitorChildVisibility() listens for scroll events in order to
 * determine which child elements are visible within the element and
 * which are not (assuming that the element itself is visible).
 *
 * When a child scrolls onscreen, it is passed to the onscreen callback.
 *
 * When a child scrolls offscreen, it is passed to the offscreen callback.
 *
 * This class also listens for DOM modification events so that it can handle
 * children being added to or removed from the scrolling element. It also
 * handles resize events.
 *
 * Note that this class only pays attention to the direct children of
 * the container element, not all ancestors.
 *
 * When you insert a new child into the container, you should create it in
 * its offscreen state. If it is inserted offscreen nothing will happen.
 * If you insert it onscreen, it will immediately be passed to the onscreen
 * callback function
 *
 * The scrollmargin argument specifies a number of pixels. Elements
 * that are within this many pixels of being onscreen are considered
 * onscreen.
 *
 * The scrolldelta parameter is also a number of pixels.  The user
 * must scroll this distance before any visibility recomputation is
 * done by this code.  This parameter can be used to "batch" up work
 * into larger chunks.
 *
 * By specifing proper onscreen and offscreen functions you can use this
 * class to (for example) remove the background-image style of elements
 * that are not visible, allowing gecko to free up image memory.
 * In that sense, this class can be used to workaround
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689623
 *
 * The return value of this function is an object that has a stop() method.
 * calling the stop method stops visiblity monitoring. If you want to restart
 * call monitorChildVisiblity() again.
 *
 * monitorChildVisiblity() makes the following assumptions. If your program
 * violates them, the function may not work correctly:
 *
 *  Child elements of the container element flow left to right and
 *  top to bottom. I.e. the nextSibling of a child element never has a
 *  smaller clientTop value. They are not absolutely positioned and don't
 *  move on their own.
 *
 *  The children of the container element are themselves all elements;
 *  there are no text nodes or comments cluttering things up.
 *
 *  Children don't change size, either spontaneously or in response to
 *  onscreen and offscreen callbacks. Don't set display:none on an element
 *  when it goes offscreen, for example.
 *
 *  Children aren't added or removed to the container while the container
 *  or any of its ancestors is hidden with display:none or is removed from
 *  the tree. The mutation observer that responds to additions and deletions
 *  needs the container and its children to have valid layout data in order
 *  to figure out what is onscreen and what is offscreen. Use visiblity:hidden
 *  instead of display:none if you need to add or remove children while
 *  the container is hidden.
 *
 *  DocumentFragments are not used to add multiple children at once to
 *  the container, and multiple children are not deleted at once by
 *  setting innerHTML or innerText to ''.
 *
 *  The container element only changes size when there is a resize event
 *  on the window.
