/**
 * Logic to help with creating, populating, and handling events involving our
 * HTML message-disply iframes.
 *
 * ## UX Goals ##
 *
 * We want a continuous scrolling experience.  The message's envelope and the
 * HTML body should scroll continuously.
 *
 * Pinch-and-zoom: We want the user to be able to zoom in and out on the message
 * in a responsive fashion without crashing the app.  We also want to start
 * with fit-to-page-width because when the email is wider than the screen it
 * tends to look stupid.
 *
 * ## Security ##
 *
 * All HTML content is passed through a white-list-based sanitization process,
 * but we still want the iframe so that:
 *
 * - We can guarantee the content can't escape out into the rest of the page.
 * - We can both avoid the content being influenced by our stylesheets as well
 *   as to allow the content to use inline "style" tags without any risk to our
 *   styling.
 *
 * Our iframe sandbox attributes (not) specified and rationale are as follows.
 * Note that "NO" means we don't specify the string in our sandbox.
 * - "allow-same-origin": YES.  We do this because in order to touch the
 *   contentDocument we need to live in the same origin.  Because scripts are
 *   not enabled in the iframe this is not believed to have any meaningful
 *   impact.
 *
 *   In the future when we are able to do nested APZ stuff, what we
 *   will likely do is have two layers of iframes.  The outer mozbrowser iframe
 *   will have its own origin but be running (only) our code.  It will talk to
 *   us via postMessage.  Then it will have a sandboxed iframe where script is
 *   disabled but that lives in the same origin.  So our code in that origin
 *   can then poke at things as needed.
 *
 * - "allow-scripts": NO.  We never ever want to let scripts from an email
 *   run.  And since we are setting "allow-same-origin", even if we did want
 *   to allow scripts we *must not* while that setting is on.  Our CSP should
 *   limit the use of scripts if the iframe has the same origin as us since
 *   everything in the iframe should qualify as
 *
 * - "allow-top-navigation": NO.  The iframe should not navigate if the user
 *   clicks on a link.  Note that the current plan is to just capture the
 *   click event and trigger the browse event ourselves so we can show them the
 *   URL, so this is just extra protection.
 *
 * - "allow-forms": NO.  We already sanitize forms out, so this is just extra
 *   protection.
 *
 * - "allow-popups": NO.  We would never want this, but it also shouldn't be
 *   possible to even try to trigger this (scripts are disabled and sanitized,
 *   links are sanitized to forbid link targets as well as being nerfed), so
 *   this is also just extra protection.
 *
 * ## Platform Limitations: We Got'em! ##
 *
 * ### Seamless iframes ###
 *
 * Gecko does not support seamless iframes, so we have to manually make sure
 * that we set the iframe's outer size to what its inner size is.  Because
 * layout is asynchronous (even in the document.write case, apparently), we end
 * up polling after any notable event that might affect layout.
 *
 * I did experiment with the gecko-specific 'overflow' event a bit.  Although I
 * suspect there were complicating factors, I do believe I ran into trouble with
 * it since it is an event that is only generated each time you transition from
 * overflow and back to underflow.  So if you get an overflow event but didn't
 * actually cause yourself to go back to underflow (like if you have weird CSS
 * maybe doing something like setting a width to 105% or something?), you won't
 * get another overflow event.
 *
 * ### Pinch-and-Zoom ###
 *
 * Gecko supports Asynchronous Pan-and-Zoom (APZ), but we can't use it for our
 * HTML pages right now because it can only be used for the root of an
 * app/browser window.  And there is no support for nested subprocesses yet.
 * When that stuff happens, we want to just use that instead of doing manual
 * pinchy-zoomy support.
 *
 * We fake some level of usable pinch-zoom by using a "transform: scale()" on
 * our iframe.  Because the transform is a painting thing and not a layout thing
 * we have to wrap the iframe in a "viewport" div that provides our effective
 * DOM size for scrolling.  We could maybe use better nomenclature for this and
 * maybe even stop nesting the iframe in the viewport.  (The current structure
 * is somewhat historical from when the viewport div actually was clipping the
 * iframe.)
 *
 * For example, let's say our iframe is internally 580px by 1000px but we are
 * displaying it at 50% scale so it's 290px by 500px.  In that case the iframe's
 * size still needs to be 580px by 1000px, but the viewport needs to be 290px by
 * 500px so that the scrolling works out right.  Otherwise you end up with lots
 * of white space at the right and bottom.
 *
 * Likewise if we are zooming it to 200% we need the viewport's dimensions to be
 * doubled so that there is the extra space to scroll into.
 *
 * ### Transform Performance / Memory Limitations ###
 *
 * We can't actually mess with "transform: scale()" in realtime.  This is
 * primarily because it results in memory spikes that can get our process killed
 * as the graphics subsystem's logic glitches and ends up allocating graphics
 * buffers for the entirety of the HTML document, even the parts not on the
 * screen.  But a secondary concern is that especially when it's drawing too
 * much, it can take a very long time to scale.
 *
 * So we've implemented a "quantized" scaling approach where we have four zoom
 * levels: "fit-to-width" (which is &lt;= 1), 100%, 150%, and 200%.  Pinching to
 * zoom in moves you to the right in the list, pinching to zoom out moves you
 * out in the list.
 *
 * We use the shared gesture_detector code to figure out what's going on.
 * Specifically, once the scale in absolute terms is clearly a zoom in or a zoom
 * out, we trigger the scale change and then ignore the rest of the gesture
 * until a new gesture occurs.  This is arguably intuitive, but more importantly
 * it avoids the problems we had in the past where you could just absurdly
 * oscillate your pinchers and kill the app as we swamped the system with a
 * gazillion transforms.
 *
 *
 * ## Email types and Pinchy-Zoomy time ##
 *
 * There are two types of HTML e-mails:
 *
 * 1) E-mails written by humans which are basically unstructured prose plus
 *    quoting.  The biggest problems these face are deep quoting causing
 *    blockquote padding to cause text to have very little screen real estate.
 *
 * 2) Newsletter style e-mails which are structured and may have multiple
 *    columns, grids of images and stuff like that.  They historically have
 *    tended to assume a size of about 600px.  However, it's increasingly common
 *    to be smart and use media queries.  Unfortunately, we don't support media
 *    queries right now and so it's very likely we'll end up in the desktop
 *    case.
 *
 * We originally treated these types of mails differently, but over time it
 * became clear that this was not a great strategy, especially since showing
 * external images/etc. could push a "normal" email into being a "newsletter"
 * email.  We also intentionally would trigger a layout with relaxed constraints
 * then try and tighten them up.
 *
 * Our (new) strategy is to create the iframe so that it fits in the width we
 * have available.  On flame devices that's 290px right now, though the actual
 * size is discovered at runtime and doesn't matter.
 *
 * As discussed above, we poll the scrollWidth and scrollHeight for a while to
 * make sure that it stabilizes.  The trick is that if something is a newsletter
 * it will end up wanting to be wider than our base/screen 290px.  We will
 * detect this and update our various dimensions, including our "fit-to-width"
 * scale.  Since we pick 100% or the computed fit-to-width scale, whichever is
 * smaller, the non-newsletter case is just us using a fit-to-width zoom factor
 * that just happens to be 100%.  The newsletter case is when fit-to-width is
 * less than 100%.
