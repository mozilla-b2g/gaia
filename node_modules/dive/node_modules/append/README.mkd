**append** one object to another.

```javascript
append(obj1, obj2)
```

Example
-------

```javascript
var a = {
	name: "a",
	width: 90,
	height: 70
};

var b = {
	name: "b",
	length: 6
};

console.log(append(a, b));
```

This will print

```
{ name: 'b', width: 90, height: 70, length: 6 }
```

As you can see, existing properties are getting replaced.
