  "readme": "# Catharsis #\n\nA JavaScript parser for\n[Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler#types)\nand [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) type expressions.\n\nCatharsis is designed to be:\n\n+ **Accurate**. Catharsis is based on a [PEG.js](http://pegjs.majda.cz/) grammar that's designed to\nhandle any valid type expression. It uses a [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) test suite\nto verify the parser's accuracy.\n+ **Fast**. Parse results are cached, so the parser is invoked only when necessary.\n+ **Flexible**. Catharsis can convert parse results back into type expressions. In addition, it can\nparse [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc)-style type expressions.\n\n\n## Example ##\n\n\tvar catharsis = require('catharsis');\n\n    var type;\n    var jsdocType;\n    var parsedType;\n    var parsedJsdocType;\n\n    // Google Closure Compiler parsing\n    try {\n        type = '!Object';\n        parsedType = catharsis.parse(type);\n        console.log('%j', parsedType);  // {\"type\":\"NameExpression,\"name\":\"Object\",\"nullable\":false}\n    }\n    catch(e) {\n        console.error('unable to parse %s: %s', type, e);\n    }\n\n    // JSDoc-style type expressions enabled\n    try {\n        jsdocType = 'string[]';  // Closure Compiler expects Array.<string>\n        parsedJsdocType = catharsis.parse(jsdocType, {jsdoc: true});\n    }\n    catch (e) {\n        console.error('unable to parse %s: %s', jsdocType, e);\n    }\n\n    console.log(catharsis.stringify(parsedType));       // !Object\n    console.log(catharsis.stringify(parsedJsdocType));  // string[]\n    console.log(catharsis.stringify(parsedJsdocType,    // Array.<string>\n        {restringify: true}));\n\n\nSee the `test/specs/` directory for more examples of Catharsis' parse results.\n\n\n## Methods ##\n\n### parse(typeExpression, options) ###\nParse `typeExpression`, and return the parse results. Throws an error if the type expression cannot\nbe parsed.\n\nWhen called without options, Catharsis attempts to parse type expressions in the same way as\nClosure Compiler. When the `jsdoc` option is enabled, Catharsis can also parse several kinds of\ntype expressions that are permitted in [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc):\n\n+ The string `function` is treated as a function type with no parameters.\n+ In a function type with repeatable parameters, the names of repeatable parameters are not required\nto be enclosed in square brackets (for example, `function(...foo)` is allowed).\n+ The period may be omitted from type applications. For example, `Array.<string>` and\n`Array<string>` will be parsed in the same way.\n+ You may append `[]` to a name expression (for example, `string[]`) to interpret it as a type\napplication with the expression `Array` (for example, `Array.<string>`).\n+ Name expressions may contain the characters `#`, `~`, `:`, and `/`.\n+ Name expressions may contain a suffix that is similar to a function signature (for example,\n`MyClass(foo, bar)`).\n+ Name expressions may contain a reserved word.\n+ Record types may use types other than name expressions for keys.\n\n#### Parameters ####\n+ `type`: A string containing a Closure Compiler type expression.\n+ `options`: Options for parsing the type expression.\n    + `options.jsdoc`: Specifies whether to enable parsing of JSDoc-style type expressions. Defaults\n    to `false`.\n    + `options.useCache`: Specifies whether to use the cache of parsed types. Defaults to `true`.\n\n#### Returns ####\nAn object containing the parse results. See the `test/specs/` directory for examples of the parse\nresults for different type expressions.\n\nThe object also includes two non-enumerable properties:\n\n+ `jsdoc`: A boolean indicating whether the type expression was parsed with JSDoc support enabled.\n+ `typeExpression`: A string containing the type expression that was parsed.\n\n### stringify(parsedType, options) ###\nStringify `parsedType`, and return the type expression. If validation is enabled, throws an error if\nthe stringified type expression cannot be parsed.\n\n#### Parameters ####\n+ `parsedType`: An object containing a parsed Closure Compiler type expression.\n+ `options`: Options for stringifying the parse results.\n    + `options.cssClass`: A CSS class to add to HTML links. Used only if `options.links` is\n    provided. By default, no CSS class is added.\n    + `options.htmlSafe`: Specifies whether to return an HTML-safe string that replaces left angle\n    brackets (`<`) with the corresponding entity (`&lt;`). **Note**: Characters in name expressions\n    are not escaped.\n    + `options.links`: An object whose keys are name expressions and whose values are URIs. If a\n    name expression matches a key in `options.links`, the name expression will be wrapped in an\n    HTML `<a>` tag that links to the URI. If `options.cssClass` is specified, the `<a>` tag will\n    include a `class` attribute. **Note**: When using this option, parsed types are always\n    restringified, and the resulting string is not cached.\n    + `options.restringify`: Forces Catharsis to restringify the parsed type. If this option is not\n    specified, and the parsed type object includes a `typeExpression` property, Catharsis will\n    return the `typeExpression` property without modification when possible. Defaults to `false`.\n    + `options.useCache`: Specifies whether to use the cache of stringified parse results. Defaults\n    to `true`.\n    + `options.validate`: Specifies whether to validate the stringified parse results by attempting\n    to parse them as a type expression. If the stringified results are not parsable by default, you\n    must also provide the appropriate options to pass to the `parse()` method. Defaults to `false`.\n\n#### Returns ####\nA string containing the type expression.\n\n\n## Installation ##\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n    npm install catharsis\n\nOr without:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/hegemonic/catharsis.git\n\n\n## Roadmap and known issues ##\n\nTake a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hegemonic/catharsis/issues) to see what's in\nstore for Catharsis.\n\nBug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are always welcome! If you're working on a large\npull request, please contact me in advance so I can help things go smoothly.\n\n**Note**: The parse tree's format should not be considered final until Catharsis reaches version\n1.0. I'll do my best to provide release notes for any changes.\n\n\n## Changelog ##\n\n+ 0.7.0 (October 2013):\n    + Repeatable type expressions other than name expressions (for example, `...function()`) are now\n    parsed and stringified correctly.\n    + Type expressions that are both repeatable and either nullable or non-nullable (for example,\n    `...!number`) are now parsed and stringified correctly.\n    + Name expressions are now parsed correctly when they match a property name in an object\n    instance (for example, `constructor`).\n+ 0.6.0 (September 2013): Added support for the type expression `function[]` when JSDoc-style type\nexpressions are enabled.\n+ 0.5.6 (April 2013):\n    + For consistency with Google Closure Library, parentheses are no longer required around type\n    unions. (In previous versions, the parentheses could be omitted when JSDoc support was enabled.)\n    + For consistency with Google Closure Library, you can now use postfix notation for the `?`\n    (nullable) and `!` (non-nullable) modifiers. For example, `?string` and `string?` are now\n    treated as equivalent.\n    + String literals and numeric literals are now allowed as property names within name\n    expressions. For example, the name expression `Foo.\"bar\"` is now parsed correctly.\n+ 0.5.5 (April 2013): Corrected a parsing issue with name expressions that end with a value enclosed\nin parentheses.\n+ 0.5.4 (April 2013):\n    + Repeatable literals (for example, `...*`) are now parsed correctly.\n    + When JSDoc-style type expressions are enabled, a name expression can now contain a value\n    enclosed in parentheses at the end of the name expression (for example, `MyClass(2)`).\n+ 0.5.3 (March 2013): The `parse()` method now correctly parses name expressions that contain\nhyphens.\n+ 0.5.2 (March 2013): The `parse()` method now correctly parses function types when JSDoc-style type\nexpressions are enabled.\n+ 0.5.1 (March 2013): Newlines and extra spaces are now removed from type expressions before they\nare parsed.\n+ 0.5.0 (March 2013):\n    + The `parse()` method's `lenient` option has been renamed to `jsdoc`. **Note**: This change is\n    not backwards-compatible with previous versions.\n    + The `stringify()` method now accepts `cssClass` and `links` options, which you can use to\n    add HTML links to a type expression.\n+ 0.4.3 (March 2013):\n    + The `stringify()` method no longer caches HTML-safe type expressions as if they were normal\n    type expressions.\n    + The `stringify()` method's options parameter may now include an `options.restringify`\n    property, and the behavior of the `options.useCache` property has changed.\n+ 0.4.2 (March 2013):\n    + When lenient parsing is enabled, name expressions can now contain the characters `:` and `/`.\n    + When lenient parsing is enabled, a name expression followed by `[]` (for example, `string[]`)\n    will be interpreted as a type application with the expression `Array` (for example,\n    `Array.<string>`).\n+ 0.4.1 (March 2013):\n    + The `parse()` and `stringify()` methods now honor all of the specified options.\n    + When lenient parsing is enabled, name expressions can now contain a reserved word.\n+ 0.4.0 (March 2013):\n    + Catharsis now supports a lenient parsing option that can parse several kinds of malformed type\n    expressions. See the documentation for details.\n    + The objects containing parse results are now frozen.\n    + The objects containing parse results now have two non-enumerable properties:\n        + `lenient`: A boolean indicating whether the type expression was parsed in lenient mode.\n        + `typeExpression`: A string containing the original type expression.\n    + The `stringify()` method now honors the `useCache` option. If a parsed type includes a\n    `typeExpression` property, and `useCache` is not set to `false`, the stringified type will be\n    identical to the original type expression.\n+ 0.3.1 (March 2013): Type expressions that begin with a reserved word, such as `integer`, are now\nparsed correctly.\n+ 0.3.0 (March 2013):\n    + The `parse()` and `stringify()` methods are now synchronous, and the `parseSync()` and\n    `stringifySync()` methods have been removed. **Note**: This change is not backwards-compatible\n    with previous versions.\n    + The parse results now use a significantly different format from previous versions. The new\n    format is more expressive and is similar, but not identical, to the format used by the\n    [doctrine](https://github.com/Constellation/doctrine) parser. **Note**: This change is not\n    backwards-compatible with previous versions.\n    + Name expressions that contain a reserved word now include a `reservedWord: true` property.\n    + Union types that are optional or nullable, or that can be passed a variable number of times,\n    are now parsed and stringified correctly.\n    + Optional function types and record types are now parsed and stringified correctly.\n    + Function types now longer include `new` or `this` properties unless the properties are defined\n    in the type expression. In addition, the `new` and `this` properties can now use any type\n    expression.\n    + In record types, the key for a field type can now use any type expression.\n    + Standalone single-character literals, such as ALL (`*`), are now parsed and stringified\n    correctly.\n    + `null` and `undefined` literals with additional properties, such as `repeatable`, are now\n    stringified correctly.\n+ 0.2.0 (November 2012):\n    + Added `stringify()` and `stringifySync()` methods, which convert a parsed type to a type\n    expression.\n    + Simplified the parse results for function signatures. **Note**: This change is not\n    backwards-compatible with previous versions.\n    + Corrected minor errors in README.md.\n+ 0.1.1 (November 2012): Added `opts` argument to `parse()` and `parseSync()` methods. **Note**: The\nchange to `parse()` is not backwards-compatible with previous versions.\n+ 0.1.0 (November 2012): Initial release.\n\n## License ##\n\n[MIT license](https://github.com/hegemonic/catharsis/blob/master/LICENSE).\n",
