# crypto-browserify

A (partial) port of `crypto` to the browser.

Basically, I found some crypto implemented in JS lieing on the internet somewhere
and wrapped it in the part of the `crypto` api that I am currently using.

In a way that will be compatible with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/).

I will extend this if I need more features, or if anyone else wants to extend this,
I will add you as a maintainer.

Provided that you agree that it should replicate the [node.js/crypto](http://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) api exactly, of course.
