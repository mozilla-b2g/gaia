THIS IS A FORK OF THE ORIGINAL MODULE.

The intent is to provide prebuilt module for installation on Mozilla tbpl to
run Gaia integration tests.

### Turn Buffer instances into "pointers"
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/ref.png)](http://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/ref)


This module is inspired by the old `Pointer` class from node-ffi, but with the
intent of using Node's fast `Buffer` instances instead of a slow C++ `Pointer`
class. These two concepts were previously very similar, but now this module
brings over the functionality that Pointers had and Buffers are missing, so
now Buffers are a lot more powerful.

### Features:

 * Get the memory address of any `Buffer` instance
 * Read/write references to JavaScript Objects into `Buffer` instances
 * Read/write `Buffer` instances' memory addresses to other `Buffer` instances
 * Read/write `int64_t` and `uint64_t` data values (Numbers or Strings)
 * A "type" convention, so that you can specify a buffer as an `int *`,
   and reference/dereference at will.
 * Offers a buffer instance representing the `NULL` pointer


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install ref
```


Examples
--------

#### referencing and derefencing

``` js
var ref = require('ref')

// so we can all agree that a buffer with the int value written
// to it could be represented as an "int *"
var buf = new Buffer(4)
buf.writeInt32LE(12345, 0)

// first, what is the memory address of the buffer?
console.log(buf.address())  // ← 140362165284824

// using `ref`, you can set the "type", and gain magic abilities!
buf.type = ref.types.int

// now we can dereference to get the "meaningful" value
console.log(buf.deref())  // ← 12345


// you can also get references to the original buffer if you need it.
// this buffer could be thought of as an "int **"
var one = buf.ref()

// and you can dereference all the way back down to an int
console.log(one.deref().deref())  // ← 12345
```

See the [full API Docs][docs] for more examples.


The "type" interface
--------------------

You can easily define your own "type" objects at attach to `Buffer` instances.
It just needs to be a regular JavaScript Object that contains the following
properties:

| **Name**      | **Data Type**                    | **Description**
|:--------------|:---------------------------------|:----------------------------------
| `size`        | Number                           | The size in bytes required to hold this type.
| `indirection` | Number                           | The current level of indirection of the buffer. Usually this would be _1_, and gets incremented on Buffers from `ref()` calls. A value of less than or equal to _0_ is invalid.
| `get`         | Function (buffer, offset)        | The function to invoke when dereferencing this type when the indirection level is _1_.
| `set`         | Function (buffer, offset, value) | The function to invoke when setting a value to a buffer instance.
| `name`        | String                           | _(optional)_ The name to use during debugging for this type.
| `alignment`   | Number                           | _(optional)_ The alignment of this type when placed in a struct. Defaults to the type's `size`.

For example, you could define a "bigint" type that dereferences into a
[`bigint`](https://github.com/substack/node-bigint) instance:

``` js
var ref = require('ref')
var bigint = require('bigint')

// define the "type" instance according to the spec
var BigintType = {
    size: ref.sizeof.int64
  , indirection: 1
  , get: function (buffer, offset) {
      // return a bigint instance from the buffer
      return bigint.fromBuffer(buffer)
    }
  , set: function (buffer, offset, value) {
      // 'value' would be a bigint instance
      var val = value.toString()
      return ref.writeInt64(buffer, offset || 0, val)
    }
}

// now we can create instances of the type from existing buffers.
// "buf" is some Buffer instance returned from some external data
// source, which should contain "bigint" binary data.
buf.type = BigintType

// and now you can create "bigint" instances using this generic "types" API
var val = buf.deref()
            .add('1234')
            .sqrt()
            .shiftLeft(5)
```
