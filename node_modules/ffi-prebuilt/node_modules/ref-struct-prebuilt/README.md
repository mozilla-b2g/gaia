THIS IS A FORK OF THE ORIGINAL MODULE.

The intent is to provide prebuilt module for installation on Mozilla tbpl to
run Gaia integration tests.

ref-struct
==========
### Create ABI-compliant "[struct][]" instances on top of Buffers
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/ref-struct.png)](http://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/ref-struct)


This module offers a "struct" implementation on top of Node.js Buffers
using the ref "type" interface.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install ref-struct
```


Examples
--------

Say you wanted to emulate the `timeval` struct from the stdlib:

``` c
struct timeval {
  time_t       tv_sec;   /* seconds since Jan. 1, 1970 */
  suseconds_t  tv_usec;  /* and microseconds */
};
```

``` js
var ref = require('ref-prebuilt')
var StructType = require('ref-struct-prebuilt')

// define the time types
var time_t = ref.types.long
var suseconds_t = ref.types.long

// define the "timeval" struct type
var timeval = StructType({
  tv_sec: time_t,
  tv_usec: suseconds_t
})

// now we can create instances of it
var tv = new timeval
```

#### With `node-ffi`

This gets very powerful when combined with `node-ffi` to invoke C functions:

``` js
var ffi = require('ffi')

var tv = new timeval
gettimeofday(tv.ref(), null)
```

#### Progressive API

You can build up a Struct "type" incrementally (useful when interacting with a
parser) using the `defineProperty()` function. But as soon as you _create_ an
instance of the struct type, then the struct type is finalized, and no more
properties may be added to it.

``` js
var ref = require('ref-prebuilt')
var StructType = require('ref-struct-prebuilt')

var MyStruct = Struct()
MyStruct.defineProperty('width', ref.types.int)
MyStruct.defineProperty('height', ref.types.int)

var i = new MyStruct({ width: 5, height: 10 })

MyStruct.defineProperty('weight', ref.types.int)
// AssertionError: an instance of this Struct type has already been created, cannot add new "fields" anymore
//      at Function.defineProperty (/Users/nrajlich/ref-struct/lib/struct.js:180:3)
```
