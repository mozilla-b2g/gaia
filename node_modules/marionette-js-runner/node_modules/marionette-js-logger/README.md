# Marionette JS Console plugin

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/lightsofapollo/marionette-js-logger.png)](https://travis-ci.org/lightsofapollo/marionette-js-logger)

Proxies console.* calls made in b2g-desktop or firefox directly to your
node host. Uses a websocket and the observer api (in firefox/b2g) to
give you reliable console.log notices without overriding the global.

## Usage

```js

// create the plugin. This must run before startSession.
client.plugin('logger', require('marionette-js-logger'));

client.startSession(function() {
  // server needs to be closed at some point (server.close());
  server = client.logger;

  // yey now console.log will be proxied to the node process!
  // you can optionally override the console.log behaviour by overriding
  // handleMessage.
  server.handleMessage = function(event) {
    event.message; // raw string of message
    event.fileName; // name where it was called
    event.lineNumber; // line number of call
  };

  // OR you can listen for the 'message' event on the server.  Use this if you
  // are not the actual test logic and so cannot guarantee that the test logic
  // will not clobber your handleMessage handler.
  server.on('message', function(event) {
    // I am literally the same event as that previous event
  };

  client.executeScript(function() {
    // this works too but more importantly all other console.log's in content work too
    console.log(document.location.href);
  });

  client.deleteSession();
});
```
