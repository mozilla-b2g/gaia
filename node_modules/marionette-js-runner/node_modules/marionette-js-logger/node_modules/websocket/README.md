WebSocket Client & Server Implementation for Node
=================================================

Overview
--------
This is a (mostly) pure JavaScript implementation of the WebSocket protocol versions 8 and 13 for Node.  There are some example client and server applications that implement various interoperability testing protocols in the "test" folder.

Documentation

Current News
------------

* Version 1.0.10 is a quick followup release to 1.0.9 that only includes one bugfix for issue #146.

* Version 1.0.9 has a bunch of bug fixes, enhancements, and new features.  For a full list, check out the the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). A few highlights:
  * Fixed the obscure "ghost connections" bug where the `WebSocketConnection` would sometimes fail to emit the `close` event when there was an error such as ECONNRESET on the underlying socket.
  * Adding option to ignore `X-Forwarded-For` headers when accepting connections from untrusted clients.
  * Can now simultaneously listen on ws:// and wss://
  * Incorporating upstream enhancements to native extensions.  Hopefully the build process on Windows will go a bit more smoothly now.
  * Better and more fair handling of buffered incoming messges under load.

* As of version 1.0.7, ***Native modules are now optional.*** If they fail to compile, WebSocket-Node will still work but will not verify that received UTF-8 data is valid, and xor masking/unmasking of payload data for security purposes will not be as efficient as it is performed in JavaScript instead of native code.

Current Version: 1.0.10

Browser Support
---------------

* Firefox 7-9 (Old) (Protocol Version 8)
* Firefox 10+ (Protocol Version 13)
* Chrome 14,15 (Old) (Protocol Version 8)
* Chrome 16+ (Protocol Version 13)
* Internet Explorer 10+ (Protocol Version 13)
* Safari 6+ (Protocol Version 13)

***Safari older than 6.0 is not supported since it uses a very old draft of WebSockets***

***If you need to simultaneously support legacy browser versions that had implemented draft-75/draft-76/draft-00, take a look here: https://gist.github.com/1428579***

For a WebSocket client written in ActionScript 3, see my [AS3WebScocket](https://github.com/Worlize/AS3WebSocket) project.

Benchmarks
----------
There are some basic benchmarking sections in the Autobahn test suite.  I've put up a [benchmark page](http://worlize.github.com/WebSocket-Node/benchmarks/) that shows the results from the Autobahn tests run against AutobahnServer 0.4.10, WebSocket-Node 1.0.2, WebSocket-Node 1.0.4, and ws 0.3.4.

Autobahn Tests
--------------
The very complete [Autobahn Test Suite](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite/) is used by most WebSocket implementations to test spec compliance and interoperability.

Notes
-----
This library has been used in production on [worlize.com](https://www.worlize.com) since April 2011 and seems to be stable.  Your mileage may vary.

**Tested with the following node versions:**

- 0.8.28
- 0.10.32

It may work in earlier or later versions but I'm not actively testing it outside of the listed versions.  YMMV.

Installation
------------

A few users have reported difficulties building the native extensions without first manually installing node-gyp.  If you have trouble building the native extensions, make sure you've got a C++ compiler, and have done `npm install -g node-gyp` first. 

Native extensions are optional, however, and WebSocket-Node will work even if the extensions cannot be compiled.

In your project root:

    $ npm install websocket
  
Then in your code:

```javascript
var WebSocketServer = require('websocket').server;
var WebSocketClient = require('websocket').client;
var WebSocketFrame  = require('websocket').frame;
var WebSocketRouter = require('websocket').router;
```

Note for Windows Users
----------------------
Because there is a small C++ component used for validating UTF-8 data, you will need to install a few other software packages in addition to Node to be able to build this module:

- [Microsoft Visual C++](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express)
- [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/) (NOT Python 3.x)


Current Features:
-----------------
- Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
- Protocol version "8" and "13" (Draft-08 through the final RFC) framing and handshake
- Can handle/aggregate received fragmented messages
- Can fragment outgoing messages
- Router to mount multiple applications to various path and protocol combinations
- TLS supported for outbound connections via WebSocketClient
- TLS supported for server connections (use https.createServer instead of http.createServer)
  - Thanks to [pors](https://github.com/pors) for confirming this!
- Cookie setting and parsing
- Tunable settings
  - Max Receivable Frame Size
  - Max Aggregate ReceivedMessage Size
  - Whether to fragment outgoing messages
  - Fragmentation chunk size for outgoing messages
  - Whether to automatically send ping frames for the purposes of keepalive
  - Keep-alive ping interval
  - Whether or not to automatically assemble received fragments (allows application to handle individual fragments directly)
  - How long to wait after sending a close frame for acknowledgment before closing the socket.


Known Issues/Missing Features:
------------------------------
- No API for user-provided protocol extensions.


Usage Examples
==============

Server Example
--------------

Here's a short example showing a server that echos back anything sent to it, whether utf-8 or binary.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
var WebSocketServer = require('websocket').server;
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
    console.log((new Date()) + ' Received request for ' + request.url);
    response.writeHead(404);
    response.end();
});
server.listen(8080, function() {
    console.log((new Date()) + ' Server is listening on port 8080');
});

wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
    httpServer: server,
    // You should not use autoAcceptConnections for production
    // applications, as it defeats all standard cross-origin protection
    // facilities built into the protocol and the browser.  You should
    // *always* verify the connection's origin and decide whether or not
    // to accept it.
    autoAcceptConnections: false
});

function originIsAllowed(origin) {
  // put logic here to detect whether the specified origin is allowed.
  return true;
}

wsServer.on('request', function(request) {
    if (!originIsAllowed(request.origin)) {
      // Make sure we only accept requests from an allowed origin
      request.reject();
      console.log((new Date()) + ' Connection from origin ' + request.origin + ' rejected.');
      return;
    }
    
    var connection = request.accept('echo-protocol', request.origin);
    console.log((new Date()) + ' Connection accepted.');
    connection.on('message', function(message) {
        if (message.type === 'utf8') {
            console.log('Received Message: ' + message.utf8Data);
            connection.sendUTF(message.utf8Data);
        }
        else if (message.type === 'binary') {
            console.log('Received Binary Message of ' + message.binaryData.length + ' bytes');
            connection.sendBytes(message.binaryData);
        }
    });
    connection.on('close', function(reasonCode, description) {
        console.log((new Date()) + ' Peer ' + connection.remoteAddress + ' disconnected.');
    });
});
```

Client Example
--------------

This is a simple example client that will print out any utf-8 messages it receives on the console, and periodically sends a random number.

*This code demonstrates a client in Node.js, not in the browser*

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
var WebSocketClient = require('websocket').client;

var client = new WebSocketClient();

client.on('connectFailed', function(error) {
    console.log('Connect Error: ' + error.toString());
});

client.on('connect', function(connection) {
    console.log('WebSocket client connected');
    connection.on('error', function(error) {
        console.log("Connection Error: " + error.toString());
    });
    connection.on('close', function() {
        console.log('echo-protocol Connection Closed');
    });
    connection.on('message', function(message) {
        if (message.type === 'utf8') {
            console.log("Received: '" + message.utf8Data + "'");
        }
    });
    
    function sendNumber() {
        if (connection.connected) {
            var number = Math.round(Math.random() * 0xFFFFFF);
            connection.sendUTF(number.toString());
            setTimeout(sendNumber, 1000);
        }
    }
    sendNumber();
});

client.connect('ws://localhost:8080/', 'echo-protocol');
```
    
Request Router Example
----------------------

For an example of using the request router, see `libwebsockets-test-server.js` in the `test` folder.
