# Mozilla Profiler Builder

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/lightsofapollo/mozilla-profile-builder.png)](https://travis-ci.org/lightsofapollo/mozilla-profile-builder)

Create profiles for mozilla runtimes (like firefox or b2g
desktop).


### Usage 

Example of using all options:

``` js
var profile = require('mozilla-profile-builder');

var options = {
  // special gaia base profile
  profile: ['gaia', '/Applications/B2G.app']
  // or use the baseProfile directly
  profile: ['baseProfile', '/Applications/B2G.app/Contents/MacOS/gaia'],
  // omit profile for a blank directory to be used as base
  
  profile: '~/workspace/gaia/profile', // or give it a string to use this profile only (no copying)

  // launch about:config in firefox for more pref names.
  prefs: {
    // turn on dump so it will output to stdout
    'browser.dom.window.dump.enabled': true,

    // bump up max workers
    'dom.workers.maxPerDomain': 100
  },

  settings: {
    // turn off first run experience
    'ftu.manifestURL': null
  },

  // also apps can be preloaded (packaged apps)
  apps: {
    'origin-for-my-app.com': '/path/to/app'
  }
};

profile.create(options, function(err, instance) {
 // instance.path
 // instance.destroy(function() {});
});


```
