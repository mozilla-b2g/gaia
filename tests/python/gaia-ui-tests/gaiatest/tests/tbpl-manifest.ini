# This manifest file has been removed from use.

# All Treeherder/Gip jobs now share the device manifest files.

# Please only disable the test for the environment you intend so as not to compromise
# on-device test coverage (often the behaviour of tests differs between the two platforms)

# Some example manifest commands to use are:

# Disable only for Treeherder/desktopb2g:
# skip-if = device == "desktop"

# Skip only for MacOS on Treeherder/desktopb2g:
# skip-if = device == "desktop" && os = "mac"

# Run only on Flame device
# run-if = device == "flame"

# To find the manifest files for respective Gip jobs:

# Gip (a)
# gaiatest/tests/accessibility/manifest.ini

# Gip (f)
# gaiatest/tests/functional/manifest.ini

# Gip (u)
# gaiatest/tests/unit/manifest.ini
