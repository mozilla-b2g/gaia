Writing tests
=============

Test writing for Marionette Python tests is described `here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Marionette/Marionette_Python_Tests>`_.

At the moment we don't have a specific style guide. Please follow the prevailing style of the existing tests. Use them as a template for writing
your tests. We follow `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ for formatting, although we're pretty lenient on the 80-character line length.
