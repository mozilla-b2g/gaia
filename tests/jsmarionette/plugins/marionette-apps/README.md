# Marionette Apps

A node library that manages Firefox OS applications through Marionette.

## Usage

```js
// create the plugin. Must come _before_ startSession
client.plugin('apps', require('marionette-apps'));

client.startSession(function() {
  // launch the app
  client.apps.launch('app://myorigin.com');

  // entrypoint variant
  client.apps.launch('app://myorigin.com', 'xfoo');

  // close a running application
  client.apps.close('app://myorigin.com');

  // entrypoint variant
  client.apps.close('app://myorigin.com', 'xfoo');

  // switch to the iframe of a given app origin  should run after launch
  client.apps.switchToApp('app://myorigin.com');
  // entrypoint variant
  client.apps.switchToApp('app://myorigin.com', 'xfoo');

  // switch to app that is run as inline activity
  client.apps.switchToActivity('app://activity.myorigin.com');
  // entrypoint variant
  client.apps.switchToActivity('app://activity.myorigin.com', '/views/my-view.html#args');


  // find all apps
  var apps = client.apps.list();

  // find a single app
  var app = client.app.getApp('app://...');
  // entrypoint variant
  var appPoint = client.app.getApp('app://', 'entrypoint');

});
