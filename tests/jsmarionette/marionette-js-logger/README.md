# Marionette JS Console plugin

Installs code into the client to buffer all of the logged console messages.
Because of the presumed synchronous operation of marionette-js-runner, Messages
are retrieved when explicitly requested or as an implict byproduct of waiting
for specific log messages.

### Usage
```js

// create the plugin. This must run before startSession.
client.plugin('logger', require('marionette-js-logger'));

client.startSession(function() {
  logGrabber = client.logger;

  // You can listen for the 'message' event, it will be fired when calls cause
  // logs to be retrieved from the server.
  logGrabber.on('message', function(msg) {
    msg.window; // The URI of the document/window the log happened in
    msg.level; // log/info/warn/error/exception/debug
    msg.message; // raw string of message
    msg.filename; // source file log call was made from
    msg.lineNumber; // line number where call was made
    msg.functionName; // function name where call was made
    msg.timeStamp; // standard JS timestamp; milliseconds since the epoch (UTC) 
  };

  // Explicitly fetch all available logs from the server, emitting 'message'
  // events.
  logGrabber.grabLogMessages();

  // Fetch all available logs from the server, but if there aren't any there
  // yet, wait for at least one new message to be logged.  This will wait for
  // at least one turn of the event loop before returning for efficiency reasons
  // and to avoid mistaken understandings of the state of the device.  Do not
  // depend on this to leave certain messages on the device.
  logGrabber.grabAtLeastOneNewMessage();

  // Keep fetching logs from the server and calling the provided method until
  // it returns true indicating it found the log message it wanted.  'message'
  // events will still be emitted for all logs retrieved as a result of these
  // calls.  While the function will only be called on messages until it returns
  // true and will not be called for any messages retrieved after the first call
  // that returns true, 'message' events will be emitted for ALL retrieved logs.
  // Also, subsequent calls to waitForLogMessage will only call the function
  // for newly retrieved logs.
  logGrabber.waitForLogMessage(function checksEveryNewMessage(msg) {
    return /my car keys/.test(msg.message);
  });

  client.executeScript(function() {
    // this works too but more importantly all other console.log's in content work too
    console.log(document.location.href);
  });

  client.deleteSession();
});
```
