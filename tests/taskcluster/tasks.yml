# This file contains the list of all currently run tasks and their chunking
# options... In the future we will likely use this to add further options and
# parameters which will allow us to customize the tasks.
#
# In particular note that the key maps directly the task named `tasks/$key.yml`
# so adding a new file here requires that the task be present.
