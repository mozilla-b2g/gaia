To generate these files:

  Contacts:
    - generate CSV file from http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/
      - include: GivenName,MiddleInitial,Surname,StreetAddress,City,State,ZipCode,CountryFull,EmailAddress,TelephoneNumber,Birthday,Occupation,Company
    - convert CSV to JSON
    - move JSON file to: gaia/test_apps/uitest/data/fakecontacts/fakecontacts.json
      - works best if you use b2g-desktop
    - if you're using b2g-desktop, cd gaia and run make
    - if you're using a real phone, rebuild, flash
    - run 'UI tests' app on phone/b2g-desktop
      - 'Contact tests'
        - 'Insert fake contacts'
    - once its done, and contacts are there, from terminal on desktop (in gaia directory):
      - abd pull /data/local/indexedDB/chrome/3406066227csotncta.sqlite test_media/reference-workload/contactsDb-XXX.sqlite
        - XXX is # of contacts
    - if you're using b2g-desktop:
      - cp profile/indexedDB/chrome/3406066227csotncta.sqlite test_media/reference-workload/contactsDb-XXX.sqlite
