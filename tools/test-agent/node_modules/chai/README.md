Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for [node](http://nodejs.org) and the browser that
can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

For more information view the [documentation](http://chaijs.com).

## Installation

Chai is available for both node.js and the browser using any
test framework you like. 

### Node.js

Package is available through [npm](http://npmjs.org):

    npm install chai

Recommend adding it to package.json devDependancies.

### Browser

Include the chai browser build in your testing suite.

    <script src="chai.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Currently supports all modern browsers: IE 9+, Chrome 7+, FireFox 4+, Safari 5+. Want to know if your browser is compatible?
Run the [online test suite](http://chaijs.com/support/tests/).

## Plugins

The Chai community is growing! Plugins allow developers to expand Chai's available 
assertions. Here is what the community has come up with so far:

* [chai-spies](https://github.com/logicalparadox/chai-spies) is a basic spy implementation for chai. It's also
a good resource for building chai plugins that work in both node.js and the browser.
* [chai-jquery](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/chai-jquery) by [@jfirebaugh](https://github.com/jfirebaugh)
provides deep jQuery integration with chai's `should` and `expect`.
* [jack](https://github.com/vesln/jack) by [@vesln](https://github.com/vesln) is a mock/stub library that 
can be used as a stand-alone or with chai.
* [sinon-chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai) by [@domenic](https://github.com/domenic) extends chai with 
assertions for the Sinon.js mocking framework.
* [chai-as-promised](https://github.com/domenic/chai-as-promised) by [@domenic](https://github.com/domenic) extends
chai with assertions about promises.
