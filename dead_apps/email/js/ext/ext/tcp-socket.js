/**
 * Proxies navigator.mozTCPSocket from the worker thread to the main
 * thread, as TCPSocket is not available on workers yet. This API is
 * largely compatible with the real mozTCPSocket implementation,
 * except for bufferedAmount and other buffering semantics (because we
 * can't synchronously retrieve those values).
 *
 * See worker-support/net-main.js for the main-thread counterpart.
 *
 * NOTE: There is also a whiteout-io/tcp-socket repo, which provides a
 * compatibility shim for TCPSocket on non-browser runtimes. This
 * module performs the same type of wrapping (i.e. exporting TCPSocket
 * directly) so that we don't have to modify browserbox/smtpclient to
 * expect a different socket wrapper module.
 *
 * ## Sending lots of data: flow control, Blobs ##
 *
 * mozTCPSocket provides a flow-control mechanism (the return value to
 * send indicates whether we've crossed a buffering boundary and
 * 'ondrain' tells us when all buffered data has been sent), but does
 * not yet support enqueueing Blobs for processing (which is part of
 * the proposed standard at
 * http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/raw-sockets/). Also, the raw-sockets
 * spec calls for generating the 'drain' event once our buffered
 * amount goes back under the internal buffer target rather than
 * waiting for it to hit zero like mozTCPSocket.
 *
 * Our main desire right now for flow-control is to avoid using a lot
 * of memory and getting killed by the OOM-killer. As such, flow
 * control is not important to us if we're just sending something that
 * we're already keeping in memory. The things that will kill us are
 * giant things like attachments (or message bodies we are
 * quoting/repeating, potentially) that we are keeping as Blobs.
 *
 * As such, rather than echoing the flow-control mechanisms over to
 * this worker context, we just allow ourselves to write() a Blob and
 * have the net-main.js side take care of streaming the Blobs over the
 * network.
 *
 * Note that successfully sending a lot of data may entail holding a
 * wake-lock to avoid having the network device we are using turned
 * off in the middle of our sending. The network-connection
 * abstraction is not currently directly involved with the wake-lock
 * management, but I could see it needing to beef up its error
 * inference in terms of timeouts/detecting disconnections so we can
 * avoid grabbing a wi-fi wake-lock, having our connection quietly
 * die, and then we keep holding the wi-fi wake-lock for much longer
 * than we should.
