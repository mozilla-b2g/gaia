/**
 * Provides a wrapper over the mozApps.getSelf() API. Structured as an
 * evt emitter, with "latest" support, and "latest" is overridden so
 * that the call to getSelf() is delayed until the very first need
 * for it.
 *
 * This allows code to have a handle on this module, instead of making
 * the getSelf() call, and then only trigger the fetch via a call to
 * latest, delaying the work until it is actually needed. Once getSelf()
 * is fetched once, the result is reused.
