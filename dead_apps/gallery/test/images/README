This directory contains images for testing the FirefoxOS Gallery app.

It also contains:

  README: this file

  creator.html: a simple web page that helps create test images

  push.sh: A shell script for pushing the test images to your phone
    in the right order and with different timestamps so that they
    appear in numerical order when scanned by the Gallery app. This
    script assumes that the sdcard is at /storage/sdcard0. It works
    for the Flame device but may not work for others.

To test the Gallery app manually with these images, follow these steps:

1) Push the images to your phone by typing ./push.sh

2) Launch the gallery app.

3) Ensure that:

   - the Gallery app scans for the test photos
   - the app does not crash with an OOM
   - the scanning process stops
   - after the scan, there should be 66 new images in Gallery.
     The first 63 and 66 display the numbers 1 to 63, 66 respectively and the
     64, 65 are test patterns. For some images, the image number is not visible
     in the thumbnail and you have to tap on the thumbnail to verify.
   - If any of the 66 images is missing, that is a bug
   - If additional images appear that may also be a bug

4) Hold the phone in portrait orientation. Tap on the first thumbnail,
   and swipe through the full set of images.  Ensure that:

   - There is no OOM while swiping
   - Images 39 to 58 are all displayed with their text right-side up
   - The images are all centered on the screen

5) Turn the phone to landscape mode and swipe back in the other
direction to ensure that all of the images display correctly in this
orientation as well

6) Now swipe again from image 14 through image 33. For each one,
double-tap to zoom in and then swipe (or double tap to zoom back out
and swipe). This should not cause an OOM even if you do it as quickly
as you can.

7) Check a few special-case images:

  - Image 6 has a transparent background, but it should be readable
  - Images 7 and 8 should be animated (but their thumbnails won't be)
  - Image 59 should change when you zoom in to it. (It has an EXIF
    preview that does not match the actual image, and we use it to test
    that the EXIF preview is used when available. It is a bug if this
    image does not change when you zoom in.)


Here are some more details about what the various images are and what
they are intended to test.

The first batch of images tests various image types to be sure we can
display them.

01.jpg: jpeg image
02.png: png image
03.gif: gif image
04.bmp: bmp image
05.jpg: progressive jpeg
06.png: png with transparent bg
07.gif: animated gif
08.png: animated png

Next, we test that we can display PNG images of various sizes

09.png: icon 128x128
10.png: hvga 320x480
11.png: wvga 480x768
12.png: fwvga: 480x854
13.png: dvga: 640x960

The next batch of images are jpegs with sizes between 1 megapixel and
64 megapixels. Gallery should be able to scan, create thumbnails, and
display all of these images without OOMs.  Of course, it is not
expected to display the big images at full resolution. It should be
possible to double-tap to zoom in on all of these images without an OOM.

14.jpg - 27.jpg: 1 to 14 mp jpeg files
28.jpg: 16mp
29.jpg: 20mp
30.jpg: 24mp
31.jpg: 32mp
32.jpg: 48mp
33.jpg: 64mp

Now we test that images of various aspect ratios can be displayed correctly

34.png: large portrait mode png
35.png: large landscape mode png
36.png: large square
37.png: wide
38.png: tall

Next we test that we can handle EXIF orientation in JPEG images
correctly. First there is a set of 8 images that should all be
displayed in portrait mode. Then 8 that should all be displayed in
landscape mode. Then four actual photos from the Tarako device that
use EXIF orientation. In all 20 of these images, the text should be
right side up and legible.

39-46.jpg: EXIF orientations 1-8, portrait
47-54.jpg: EXIF orientations 1-8, landscape
55-58.jpg: pictures from Tarako

Next is a series of JPEG images that test our use of EXIF preview
images. Image 59 has a preview image that is different than the real
image. You should see it change if you double-tap to zoom in. This
tests that we are using previews when they are valid. The remaining
four images have invalid or corrupt EXIF previews and should not
display a preview.

59.jpg: image with valid exif preview that changes when zoomed
60.jpg: exif preview is too small, should never see it (thumbnail only?)
61.jpg: exif preview has wrong aspect ratio should never see it
62.jpg: exif preview is corrupt should not crash or hang the scan
63.jpg: exif preview is corrupt and has no metadata

We end with two test patterns. These might be useful for looking at
the quality of our image downsampling.

64.png: test pattern
65.jpg: test pattern
66.jpg: JPEG image with size 90 x 40 smaller than thumbnail container

Finally, there is a set of images that should not display in the
gallery app. These will be rejected during scanning, and error
messages will be printed in the logcat. The first four images don't
display because they are too large. If they appear, it probably means
you're running a high-end device with a different maximum image size
configuration. The other images are actually corrupt and can not
display. They are here to ensure that the metadata scanner does not
choke on them.

x01.png: png that is > 5mp
x02.gif: gif that is > 5mp
x03.jpg: pjpeg that is > 3.33mp
x04.bmp: bmp that has file size > 500kb
x05.png: a zero length file
x06.jpg: a text file that has an image extension
x07.jpg: a corrupt jpeg file (a zero byte change. gecko can't display it)
x08.jpg: truncated jpeg
x09.png: truncated png
x10.gif: truncated gif
x11.bmp: truncated bmp
