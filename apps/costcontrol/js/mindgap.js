/*
 * This module is in charge of keep the historical of SIM changes in order
 * to rebuild the accurate usage of each SIM.
 *
 * This is needed due to two Statistics API limitations:
 * 1- There is no distinction per SIM in BE
 * 2- The minimum resolution is 24 hours.
 *
 * Bascically, the data structure is a list of tags. A tag is an object with a
 * SIM id, start and end dates that labels the usage during this period to
 * belong the SIM with that id.
 *
 * Take a look to this example:
 * ============================
 *
 * [{sim:"A", start: 1, actual: 2000,               offset: 2000, end:  2},
 *  {sim:"B", start: 2, actual: 5000, fixing: 3000, offset: 2000, end:  3},
 *  {sim:"A", start: 3, actual: 6000,               offset: 3000, end:  4},
 *  {sim:"B", start: 4, actual:16000 ,              offset:12000, end: 72},
 *  {sim:"A", start:72}]
 *
 * Each row is a Tag. Suppose times are hours in a day. Let's verbose these
 * lines:
 *
 * First row means from time 1 to 2, usage belongs to A and when A was removed
 * there was a real ussage of 2000 bytes and A consumed 2000 bytes as well.
 *
 * Second row means from time 2 to 3, usage belongs to B. B was reset when a
 * real consumption of 3000 bytes was done and removed when actual consumption
 * of 5000 was. So the total for B is 5000 - 3000 = 2000, the offset value.
 *
 * Third means from time 3 to 4, usage belongs to A again and, at the moment
 * of switching, the real usage was 6000 so the SIM usage is the new usage
 * from the former SIM to this (6000 - 5000 = 1000) plus the usage the same
 * SIM had before, this is, the last offset of the last tag with same SIM
 * (1000 + 2000 = 3000).
 *
 * Fourth means from time 4 to 72, usage belongs to B again.
 * Current value: 16000
 * Offset value: new usage + last offset = (16000 - 6000) + 2000 = 12000
 *
 * The last one means sim A was inserted at time 48 and is currently inserted.
 *
 * This example show how the limitations affect the frontend. Limitation 1 avoid
 * us to make a API reset because we were erasing all data including that not
 * belonging to us.
 *
 * Limitation 2 compels us to get the total usage by day. There is no doubt
 * about which SIM used the mobile interface for day 2 (time 24 to 48). It was
 * SIM B but, what happend during day 1 (time 0 to 24) or day 3 (time 48 to 72)?
 *
 * The module involves three mechanisms:
 * =====================================
 *
 * 1- Building the list of tags
 * ----------------------------
 * In order to build the list of tags, the module should be informed as soon as
 * the device is started to check if a SIM change was made. If so, the last tag
 * is closed and a new one open.
 *
 * Closing a tag is to compute current and offset values and set the end date.
 * Opening a tag is to add a new tag object with the SIM id and the start date.
 *
 * > current value is got by asking Statistics API for the actual value at the
 *   moment of the switch.
 *
 * > offset value is calculated by:
 *   a) if there is a fixing value -> offset = actual - fixing
 *   b) if there is only one tag   -> offset = actual
 *   c) if there is more than one, -> offset =
 *      (actual - <previous tag's current>) + <last tag with same SIM's offset>
 *
 * 2- Setting a fixing value
 * -------------------------
 * To simulate a reset, we need to take in count the amount spent at that moment
 * and keep it to correct the consumption of that SIM. This is done by setting
 * the fixing value to the real data spent at the moment of the reset.
 * This operation is not here but in the common.js module due to should be
 * accessed from several entry points of the application. Take a look at
 * resetData() method.
 *
 * In addition, when a reset is done, former references to the same SIM in the
 * tag list are deleted keeping the list short.
 *
 * 3- Getting the usage for a SIM in a goal date
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * To get this value we need to retrieve an ordered subset of the tag list
 * labelling the goal date. We say a tag labels a date if:
 *   a) tag's start or end refer to the same day as date or
 *   b) date is between tag's start and tag's end or
 *   c) date is latter then tag's start and there is no tag's end
 *
 * Now passing through this subset in reverse order we look for the first tag
 * with the SIM required. Two cases can occur:
 *   a) if the tag has no end or the end is not the goal date, -> usage =
 *      (actual - <previous tag's current>) + <last tag with same SIM's offset>
 *   b) else -> usage = tag's offset
 *
 * Conclussions
 * ============
 * With these 3 mechanisms we can provide accurate data usage statistics about
 * which SIM spent what data in the device. It is impossible to know about
 * consumption out of the device.
 *
 * Current implementation is not optimal in terms of space not time but it
 * has been made to meet scheduling constrins.
