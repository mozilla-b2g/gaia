The game is an MMO and a chat room. You can meet up with your friends, chat, play a round of poker, listen to the piano player as you watch the dancing girls...oh...and smash each other over the head with chairs of course! All in glorious third person perspective (also in actual 3D if you bring your own glasses!). The wardrobe department lets you customize your character and set your stats."
