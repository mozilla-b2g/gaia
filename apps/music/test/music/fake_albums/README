createFakeAlbums.sh is a script that takes a single number as its
argument, and pushes that many .mp3 files to the FakeMusic/ directory
on the attached device's sdcard.

Each song has a different album name, so each song counts as its own
album. Each song has an 800x600 jpeg file as its album art.

This is intended for stress-testing the music app with many album art
images.
