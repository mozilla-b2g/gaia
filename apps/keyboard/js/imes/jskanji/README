About Dictionary

The IME dictionary is converted from NAIST Japanese Dictionary project with following steps:
1. Get a copy of `naist-jdic-0.4.3.tar.gz` at 
  http://sourceforge.jp/projects/naist-jdic/releases/

2. Extract all .dic files to dict/src/.

3. Run `make` under the `dict` directory to generate dict.json.

The tool of `dict/jcconv.py` is getting from https://github.com/taichino/jcconv.


Note:
  Running `make` on Windows is not recommended. You have to take care of some encoding issues.
