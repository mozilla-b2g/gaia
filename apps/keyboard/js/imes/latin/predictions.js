// This is a JavaScript predictive text engine: given a dictionary, a data
// structure that specifies which keys are near which other keys, and
// a string of user input, it guesses what the user meant to type or, (if
// if cannot find a word loosely matching the input) what the user is planning
// to type.
//
// *** Notes on Documentation ***
//
// We have moved the overview documentation for prediction mechanism to Mozilla
// Wiki: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/System/Keyboard/IME/Latin
//                                              /Prediction_%26_Auto_Correction
//
// The documentation includes definitions of terminology and a few examples on
// the prediciton process.
//
// Please make sure any updates to the codes are reflected in the wiki too.
//
//
// This module defines a single global variable Predictions which is an
// object with the following methods:
//
//   setDictionary: specifies the dictionary to use
//
//   setNearbyKeys: specifies which keys are near which other keys
//
//   predict: given an input string, asynchronously find corrections or
//      predictions and pass them to a specified callback.
//
// The core part of the matching algorithm is in the process() function
// nested inside the predict() method. To fully understand it, however, you
// also need to understand the weighted Ternary Search Tree data structure
// used to represent the dictionary.
//
// The illustration of the Ternary Search Tree structure may be found at the
// Wiki page above.
//
// Also see the following online resources which include helpful diagrams:
//
//   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_search_tree
//   http://www.strchr.com/ternary_dags
//   http://www.strchr.com/dawg_predictive
//
// Note that this implementation does not convert the TST into a DAG to
// share common suffix nodes as described in the strchr.com blog
// posts. (That is an optimization that may be possible later: the shared
// suffix nodes can't hold correct word frequencies, so the search
// algorithm would have to be modified to carry the correct frequency
// through while processing a shared suffix.)
//
// TODO:
//
// Also have to figure out if something is going wrong with Polish.
// When I type an unaccented character, I'm not confident that I'm
// getting predictions that include accented versions of that character.

    // This function is the heart of the dictionary search algorithm. The

    // level, we visit the nodes in frequency order, following the next
    // pointer. If we find nodes that loosely match the first character of
    // the remaining input, we use those nodes to generate new candidates for
    // further evaluation later. This is defined as a GrowOperation in the Wiki
    // article linked at the beginning of this file.
    //
    // Note that by maintaining a list of candidates like this, we're doing a
    // breadth-first search rather than a depth-first search. (But since we
    // weight the candidates and put them in a priority queue, it is not a pure
    // breadth-first search).
    //
    // A candidate specifies a node in the dictionary tree, the remaining part
    // of the user's input, and the output generated so far.
    // This function uses the dictionary to loop through all possible characters
    // that could appear after the current output, and considers those
    // characters in most frequent to least frequent order. It compares each
    // character to the first character (or, in certain GrowOperations, first
    // two characters) of the remainder of user's input and generates new
    // candidates based on that comparison.
    //
    // The candidate generation considers things such as accented characters
    // from the dictionary, nearby keys from the keyboard layout and the
    // possibility of user input errors such as transpositions and
    // omissions.
