# Latin word list dictionaries

Many of the word lists in this directory are open-source files from
the Android source code. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME/+/master/dictionaries/

The Bulgarian (bg), Catal√† (ca), Hungarian (hu), Romanian (ro), and
Slovak (sk) wordlists were generated by Professor Kevin Scannell of
Saint Louis University http://borel.slu.edu/

The Latin version of the Serbian wordlist (sr-Latn) was automatically
generated from the cyrillic wordlist (sr-Cyrl) using this converter:
http://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/serbian_conversion.htm
The cyrillic wordlist is simply a renamed version of the Android wordlist.

The Basque wordlist was generated by Dr. Igor Leturia from Elhuyar Fundazioa
(http://www.elhuyar.org), based on a 200 Mw corpus collected from the web.

The Welsh wordlist was generated with https://github.com/gmarty/wordlist-generator.

The Ukrainian (uk) wordlist was originally generated by Volodymyr Vlad http://u-mova.blogspot.com/2013/09/blog-post.html

The xml2dict.js script in this directory converts the wordlists into
the Firefox OS binary dictionary format. These wordlists are not part
of the Firefox OS build, but the binary dictionaries are copied into
the keyboard app at build time.
