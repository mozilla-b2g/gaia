Many of the word lists in this directory are open-source files from
the Android source code. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME/+/master/dictionaries/

The Bulgarian (bg), Català (ca), Hungarian (hu), Romanian (ro), and
Slovak (sk) wordlists were generated by Professor Kevin Scannell of
Saint Louis University http://borel.slu.edu/

The Latin version of the Serbian wordlist (sr-Latn) was automatically
generated from the cyrillic wordlist (sr-Cyrl) using this converter:
http://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/serbian_conversion.htm
The cyrillic wordlist is simply a renamed version of the Android wordlist.

The xml2dict.py script in this directory converts the wordlists into
the FirefoxOS binary dictionary format. These wordlists are not part
of the FirefoxOS build, but the binary dictionaries are copied into
the keyboard app at build time.
