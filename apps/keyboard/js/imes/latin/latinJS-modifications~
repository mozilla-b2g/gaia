The new latin.js is now capable of:
1. Making an in-memory user dictionary,
2. Recording the frequency of words.
3. Spawn a userWorker to run the new prediction engine and predict words from the saved user dictionary

The addition of words is determined with the following criterion:
1. there are no suggestions to display- whatever the user enters is added;
2. the user dismisses the suggestions by tapping the (X) button;
3. the user revert to the typed word after it has been auto-corrected.
