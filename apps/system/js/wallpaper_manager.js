   * This system module reads the system wallpaper setting on startup
   * and monitors changes to that setting, broadcasting a
   * 'wallpaperchange' event with a blob: URL to tell the system and
   * lockscreen about the new wallpaper.
   *
   * If the wallpaper value read from the settings DB is a URL this
   * module converts it to a blob. If the wallpaper image does not
   * exactly match the size of the screen, this module resizes it
   * (lazy-loading shared/js/image_utils.js when needed). If the
   * wallpaper value is converted to a blob or resized, the modified
   * value is saved back to the settings DB so that it will not need
   * to be modified the next time it is read.
   *
   * start(), stop(), and getBlobURL() are the only public methods,
   * and stop() is only exposed for the benefit of unit
   * tests. _setWallpaper() is called on startup and whenever the
   * wallpaper.image setting changes. Each call to _setWallpaper()
   * eventually causes a call to _publish() which broadcasts the new
   * wallpaper event to the lockscreen and the rest of the system
   * app. The call to _publish() does not always happen directly,
   * however: _setWallpaper() may call _checkSize(), which calls
   * _publish(), or it may call _toBlob() which calls _checkSize().
   * Unless the build is mis-configured and the wallpaper in the
   * settings db and the fallback default wallpaper is broken, every
   * call to _setWallpaper() ends up broadcasting a 'wallpaperchange'
   * event with a valid blob: url for a wallpaper image that has the
   * same size as the screen.
