/**
 * UtilityTrayMotion manages the scrolling and snapping behavior of the
 * UtilityTray.
 *
 * UtilityTrayMotion emits the following custom events from its root element:
 *
 * - "tray-motion-state", emitted when the element changes state.
 * - "tray-motion-footer-position", emitted when the tray moves in such a way
 *   that you might want to show or hide the fixed-position footer.
 *
 * The state of the utility tray motion (UtilityTrayMotion.state) will always
 * be one of "opening", "closing", "open", or "closed".
 *
 * Rather than manually intercepting touch events to provide momentum, we use
 * native scrolling to improve performance. A scrollable root div contains two
 * sections, one with the utility tray contents, and one transparent unclickable
 * area. When the tray is closed, only the invisible (dead area) fits on the
 * screen; when the tray is open, only the visible area fits onscreen. Hence
 * the screen is always overlaid with the utility tray, but the dead area
 * has "pointer-events: none". See the following layout diagram:
 *
 *

 *   | |   (opaque, grabbable)               |

 *   +=====================================+
 *
 *
 * Note that we do _not_ use CSS scroll snapping here. As of July 2015, CSS
 * scroll snapping's velocity calculations do not include the element's current
 * scroll velocity when calculating fling velocity; this means that upon lifting
 * your finger, you would be unable to scroll the utility tray quickly. Instead,
 * we listen to scroll events, and based upon the current tray velocity and
 * position, we decide when to fling the tray ourselves.
 *
 * With this implementation, if you fling the tray really fast, we recognize
 * that the tray will make it to the final scroll position without assistance;
 * this triggers the platform bounce effects. If you fling the tray too slowly,
 * we'll recognize that the tray will get stuck in the middle of the screen,
 * so we push it the rest of the way with `scrollTo()`.
 *
 *------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TRACKING SCROLL POSITION
 *
 * Because we now support asynchronous scrolling (APZ), we can never predict
 * the element's exact scroll position at any given time. We can monitor touch
 * and scroll events, but `scrollTop` is always an out-of-date snapshot.
 * We cannot cancel scroll events synchronously, nor can we rely on touch events
 * to calculate the element's curent scroll offset, because the platform applies
 * momentum itself.
 *
 * Fortunately, we can compensate for this lack of control by tracking the
 * element's scrollTop whenever a touch or scroll event occurs. In this way,
 * we can update the tray state ('open', 'closed', 'opening', 'closing') in
 * response to changes in scroll position. When we need to move the tray
 * manually, we use `scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth'})`.
