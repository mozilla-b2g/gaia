# The error for when the user tries to create an account without a network

setup-error-offline=This device is currently offline. Connect to a network and try again.
# The error for either a bad username or a bad password.  For security reasons,
# servers try not to distinguish between the two which is why we also cannot
# tell them apart either.  Also, if the user made a typo, they could have made
# it in either place.
setup-error-bad-user-or-pass2=Invalid username or password. Check for typos.
# The error for a user having the correct username and password, but the mail
# server explicitly indicates they don't have permission to talk to the mail

# like gmail over IMAP indicating that IMAP is disabled for the account or
# domain have their own error code: setup-error-imap-disabled.

# The fallback error; if we don't have a better error, we report this.

# a text message on your phone or run a special app) is enabled, and so the
# user needs to create and use an application specific password to allow us to
# talk to the server.
setup-error-needs-app-pass=You must use an application specific password for two-factor Gmail accounts
# The error for Gmail accounts where IMAP is not enabled.  This can occur

# to support IMAP.

setup-error-unresponsive-server=Unable to establish a connection with "{{server}}". There may be a problem with the network.
# The error for when we able to establish a (secure) connection with the server,
# but there is some type of failure talking to the server that isn't covered by
# other errors.  Hopefully this is just a temporary problem on the server, but
# it could also be a fundamental incompatibility between our software and the
# server's software.
setup-error-server-problem=There is a problem with the server "{{server}}". Try again later.
# The error for when we are trying to figure out the right server settings for
# an account based on the e-mail address the user typed in during configuration,
# but we can't find the right settings.  This is either because the user made a
# typo and so we are looking for configuration data that does not exist, there
# were network failures trying to look the information up, or the information is
# not available.
setup-error-no-config-info=Unable to automatically configure your account. Correct your e-mail address or try the manual configuration option.
# The error for when the user is trying to set up an account with a server that
