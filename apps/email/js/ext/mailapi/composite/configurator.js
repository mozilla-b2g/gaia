/**
 * Error-handling/backoff logic.
 *
 * - All existing-account network-accessing functionality uses this module to
 *   track the state of accounts and resources within accounts that are may
 *   experience some type of time-varying failures.
 * - Account autoconfiguration probing logic does not use this module; it just
 *   checks whether there is a network connection.
 *
 * - Accounts define 'endpoints' with us when they are instantiated for each
 *   server connection type they have.  For IMAP, this means an SMTP endpoint
 *   and an IMAP endpoint.
 * - These 'endpoints' may have internal 'resources' which may manifest failures
 *   of their own if-and-only-if it is expected that there could be transient
 *   failures within the endpoint.  For IMAP, it is possible for IMAP servers to
 *   not let us into certain folders because there are other active connections
 *   inside them.  If something can't fail, there is no need to name it as a
 *   resource.
 *
 * - All endpoints have exactly one status: 'healthy', 'unreachable', or
 *   'broken'.  Unreachable implies we are having trouble talking with the
 *   endpoint because of network issues.  Broken implies that although we can
 *   talk to the endpoint, it doesn't want to talk to us for reasons of being
 *   offline for maintenance or account migration or something like that.
 * - Endpoint resources can only be 'broken' and are only tracked if they are
 *   broken.
 *
 * - If we encounter a network error for an otherwise healthy endpoint then we
 *   try again once right away, as a lot of network errors only become evident
 *   once we have a new, good network.
 * - On subsequent network errors for the previously healthy endpoint where we
 *   have already retried, we try after a ~1 second delay and then a ~5 second
 *   delay.  Then we give up and put the endpoint in the unreachable or broken
 *   state, as appropriate.  These choice of delays are entirely arbitrary.
 *
 * - We only try once to connect to endpoints that are in a degraded state.  We
 *   do not retry because that would be wasteful.
 *
 * - Once we put an endpoint in a degraded (unreachable or broken) state, this
 *   module never does anything to try and probe for the endpoint coming back
 *   on its own.  We rely on the existing periodic synchronization logic or
 *   user actions to trigger a new attempt.  WE MAY NEED TO CHANGE THIS AT
 *   SOME POINT since it's possible that the user may have queued an email for
 *   sending that they want delivered sooner than the cron logic triggers, but
 *   that's way down the road.

 *

 *     update progress.

 * notifications when flags change.  (This is my current understanding of how
 * gmail operates from internet searches; we're not quite yet to protocol
 * experimentation yet.)
 *
 * The idea is accordingly that we will use IDLE notifications as a hint that
 * we should do a SEARCH for new messages.  It is that search that will update
 * our accuracy information and only that.

/**
 * Abstractions for dealing with the various mutation operations.
 *
 * NB: Moves discussion is speculative at this point; we are just thinking
 * things through for architectural implications.
 *
 * == Speculative Operations ==
 *
 * We want our UI to update as soon after requesting an operation as possible.
 * To this end, we have logic to locally apply queued mutation operations.
 * Because we may want to undo operations when we are offline (and have not
 * been able to talk to the server), we also need to be able to reflect these
 * changes locally independent of telling the server.
 *
 * In the case of moves/copies, we issue a(n always locally created) id for the
 * message immediately and just set the server UID (srvid) to 0 to be populated
 * by the sync process.
 *
 * == Data Integrity ==
 *
 * Our strategy is always to avoid server data-loss, so data-destruction actions
 * must always take place after successful confirmation of persistence actions.
 * (Just keeping the data in-memory is not acceptable because we could crash,
 * etc.)
 *
 * This is in contrast to our concern about losing simple, frequently performed
 * idempotent user actions in a crash.  We assume that A) crashes will be
 * rare, B) the user will not be surprised or heart-broken if a message they
 * marked read a second before a crash needs to manually be marked read after
 * restarting the app/device, and C) there are performance/system costs to
 * saving the state which makes this a reasonable trade-off.
 *
 * It is also our strategy to avoid cluttering up the place as a side-effect
 * of half-done things.  For example, if we are trying to move N messages,
 * but only copy N/2 because of a timeout, we want to make sure that we
 * don't naively retry and then copy those first N/2 messages a second time.
 * This means that we track sub-steps explicitly, and that operations that we
 * have issued and may or may not have been performed by the server will be
 * checked before they are re-attempted.  (Although IMAP batch operations
 * are atomic, and our IndexedDB commits are atomic, they are atomic independent
 * of each other and so we could have been notified that the copy completed
 * but not persisted the fact to our database.)
 *
 * In the event we restore operations from disk that were enqueued but
 * apparently not run, we compel them to run a check operation before they are
 * performed because it's possible (depending on the case) for us to have run
 * them without saving the account state first.  This is a trade-off between the
 * cost of checking and the cost of issuing commits to the database frequently
 * based on the expected likelihood of a crash on our part.  Per comments above,
 * we expect crashes to be rare and not particularly correlated with operations,
 * so it's better for the device (both flash and performance) if we don't
 * continually checkpoint our state.
 *
 * All non-idempotent operations / operations that could result in data loss or
 * duplication require that we save our account state listing the operation.  In
 * the event of a crash, this allows us to know that we have to check the state
 * of the operation for completeness before attempting to run it again and
 * allowing us to finish half-done things.  For particular example, because
 * moves consist of a copy followed by flagging a message deleted, it is of the
 * utmost importance that we don't get in a situation where we have copied the
 * messages but not deleted them and we crash.  In that case, if we failed to
 * persist our plans, we will have duplicated the message (and the IMAP server
 * would have no reason to believe that was not our intent.)

  // move: Move messages between folders (in a single account)
  //
  // ## General Strategy ##
  //
  // Local Do:
  //
  // - Move the header to the target folder's storage, updating the op with the
  //   message-id header of the message for each message so that the check
  //   operation has them available.
  //
  //   This requires acquiring a write mutex to the target folder while also
  //   holding one on the source folder.  We are assured there is no deadlock
  //   because only operations are allowed to manipulate multiple folders at
  //   once, and only one operation is in-flight per an account at a time.
  //   (And cross-account moves are not handled by this operation.)
  //
  //   Insertion is done using the INTERNALDATE (which must be maintained by the
  //   COPY operation) and a freshly allocated id, just like if we had heard
  //   about the header from the server.
  //
  // Do:
  //
  // - Acquire a connection to the target folder so that we can know the UIDNEXT
  //   value prior to performing the copy.  FUTURE: Don't do this if the server
  //   supports UIDPLUS.
  //
  // (Do the following in a loop per-source folder)
  //
  // - Copy the messages to the target folder via COPY.
  //
  // - Figure out the UIDs of our moved messages.  FUTURE: If the server is
  //   UIDPLUS, we already know these from the results of the previous command.
  //   NOW: Issue a fetch on the message-id headers of the messages in the
  //   range UIDNEXT:*.  Use these results to map the UIDs to the messages we
  //   copied above.  In the event of duplicate message-id's, ordering doesn't
  //   matter, we just pick the first one.  Update our UIDNEXT value in case
  //   there is another pass through the loop.
  //
  // - Issue deletes on the messages from the source folder.
  //
  // Check: XXX TODO POSTPONED FOR PRELIMINARY LANDING
  //
  // NB: Our check implementation actually is a correcting check implemenation;
  // we will make things end up the way they should be.  We do this because it
  // is simpler than
  //
  // - Acquire a connection to the target folder.  Issue broad message-id
  //   header searches to find if the messages appear to be in the folder
  //   already, note which are already present.  This needs to take the form
  //   of a SEARCH followed by a FETCH to map UIDs to message-id's.  In theory
  //   the IMAP copy command should be atomic, but I'm not sure we can trust
  //   that and we also have the problem where there could already be duplicate
  //   message-id headers in the target which could confuse us if our check is
  //   insufficiently thorough.  The FETCH needs to also retrieve the flags
  //   for the message so we can track deletion state.
  //
  // (Do the following in a loop per source folder)
  //
  // - Acquire connections for each source folder.  Issue message-id searches
  //   like we did for the target including header results.  In theory we might
  //   remember the UIDs for check acceleration purposes, but that would not
  //   cover if we tried to perform an undo, so we go for thorough.
  //
  // -
  //
  // ## Possible Problems and their Solutions ##
  //
  // Moves are fairly complicated in terms of moving parts, so let's enumate the
  // way things could go wrong so we can make sure we address them and describe
  // how we address them.  Note that it's a given that we will have run our
  // local modifications prior to trying to talk to the server, which reduces
  // the potential badness.
  //
  // #1: We attempt to resynchronize the source folder for a move prior to
  //     running the operation against the server, resulting in us synchronizing
  //     a duplicate header into existence that will not be detected until the
  //     next resync of the time range (which will be strictly after when we
  //     actually run the mutation.
  //
  // #2: Operations scheduled against speculative headers.  It is quite possible
  //     for the user to perform actions against one of the locally /
  //     speculatively moved headers while we are offline/have not yet played
  //     the operation/are racing the UI while playing the operation.  We
  //     obviously want these changes to succeed.
  //
  // Our solutions:
  //
  // #1: Prior to resynchronizing a folder, we check if there are any operations
  //     that block synchronization.  An un-run move with a source of that
  //     folder counts as such an operation.  We can determine this by either
  //     having sufficient knowledge to inspect an operation or have operations
  //     directly modify book-keeping structures in the folders as part of their
  //     actions.  (Add blocker on local_(un)do, remove on (un)do.)  We choose
  //     to implement the inspection operation by having all operations
  //     implement a simple helper to tell us if the operation blocks entry.
  //     The theory is this will be less prone to bugs since it will be clear
  //     that operations need to implement the method, whereas it would be less
  //     clear that operations need to do call the folder-state mutating
  //     options.
  //
  // #2: Operations against speculative headers are a concern only from a naming
  //     perspective for operations.  Operations are strictly run in the order
  //     they are enqueued, so we know that the header will have been moved and
  //     be in the right folder.  Additionally, because both the UI and
  //     operations name messages using an id we issue rather than the server
  //     UID, there is no potential for naming inconsistencies.  The UID will be
  //     resolved at operation run-time which only requires that the move
  //     operation either was UIDPLUS or we manually sussed out the target id
  //     (which we do for simplicity).
  //
  // XXX problem: repeated moves and UIDs.
  // what we do know:
  // - in order to know about a message, we must have a current UID of the
  //   message on the server where it currently lives.
  // what we could do:
  // - have successor move operations moot/replace their predecessor.  So a
  //   move from A to B, and then from B to C will just become a move from A to
  //   C from the perspective of the online op that will eventually be run.  We
  //   could potentially build this on top of a renaming strategy.  So if we
  //   move z-in-A to z-in-B, and then change a tag on z-in-B, and then move
  //   z-in-B to z-in-C, renaming and consolidatin would make this a move of
  //   z-in-A to z-in-C followed by a tag change on z-in-C.
  // - produce micro-IMAP-ops as a byproduct of our local actions that are
  //   stored on the operation.  So in the A/move to B/tag/move to C case above,
  //   we would not consolidate anything, just produce a transaction journal.
  //   The A-move-to-B case would be covered by serializing the information
  //   for the IMAP COPY and deletion.  In the UIDPLUS case, we have an
  //   automatic knowledge of the resulting new target UID; in the non-UIDPLUS
  //   case we can open the target folder and find out the new UID as part of
  //   the micro-op.  The question here is then how we chain these various
  //   results together in the multi-move case, or when we write the result to
  //   the target:
  //   - maintain an output value map for the operations.  When there is just
  //     the one move, the output for the UID for each move is the current
  //     header name of the message, which we will load and write the value
  //     into.  When there are multiple moves, the output map is adjusted and
  //     used to indicate that we should stash the UID in quasi-persistent
  //     storage for a subsequent move operation.  (This could be thought of
  //     as similar to the renaming logic, but explicit.)
