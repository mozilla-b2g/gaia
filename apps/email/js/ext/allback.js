/**
 * A lightweight deferred 'run-all'-like construct for waiting for
 * multiple callbacks to finish executing, with a final completion
 * callback at the end. Neither promises nor Q provide a construct
 * quite like this; Q.all and Promise.all tend to either require all
 * promises to be created up front, or they return when the first
 * error occurs. This is designed to allow you to wait for an unknown
 * number of callbacks, with the knowledge that they're going to
 * execute anyway -- no sense trying to abort early.
 *
 * Results passed to each callback can be passed along to the final
 * result by adding a `name` parameter when calling latch.defer().
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * var latch = allback.latch();
 * setTimeout(latch.defer('timeout1'), 200);
 * var cb = latch.defer('timeout2');
 * cb('foo');
 * latch.then(function(results) {
 *   console.log(results.timeout2[0]); // => 'foo'
 * });
 *
 * The returned latch is an A+ Promises-compatible thennable, so you
 * can chain multiple callbacks to the latch.
 *
 * The promise will never fail; it will always succeed. Each
 * `.defer()` call can be passed a `name`; if a name is provided, that
 * callback's arguments will be made available as a key on the result
 * object.
 *
 * NOTE: The latch will not actually fire completion until you've
 * attached a callback handler. This way, you can create the latch
 * before you know how many callbacks you'll need; when you've called
 * .defer() as many times as necessary, you can call `then()` to
 * actually fire the completion function (when they have all
 * completed).
