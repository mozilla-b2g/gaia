/**
 * Centralize the creation of our header and body object representations.
 *
 * We provide constructor functions which take input objects that should
 * basically look like the output object, but the function enforces
 * consistency and provides the ability to assert about the state of the
 * representation at the call-site.  We discussed making sure to check
 * representations when we are inserting records into our database, but we
 * might also want to opt to do it at creation time too so we can explode
 * slightly closer to the source of the problem.
 *
 * This module will also provide representation checking functions to make
 * sure all the data structures are well-formed/have no obvious problems.
