/**
 * Logic to help with creating, populating, and handling events involving our
 * HTML message-disply iframes.
 *
 * All HTML content is passed through a white-list-based sanitization process,
 * but we still want the iframe so that:
 *
 * - We can guarantee the content can't escape out into the rest of the page.
 * - We can both avoid the content being influenced by our stylesheets as well
 *   as to allow the content to use inline "style" tags without any risk to our
 *   styling.
 * - We MAYBE SOMEDAY get the security benefits of an iframe "sandbox".
 *
 * Our iframe sandbox attributes (not) specified and rationale are:
 * - "allow-same-origin": YES.  We do this because in order to touch the
 *   contentDocument we need to live in the same origin.  Because scripts are
 *   not enabled in the iframe this is not believed to have any meaningful
 *   impact.
 * - "allow-scripts": NO.  We never ever want to let scripts from an email
 *   run.  And since we are setting "allow-same-origin", even if we did want
 *   to allow scripts we *must not* while that setting is on.  Our CSP should
 *   limit the use of scripts if the iframe has the same origin as us since
 *   everything in the iframe should qualify as
 * - "allow-top-navigation": NO.  The iframe should not navigate if the user
 *   clicks on a link.  Note that the current plan is to just capture the
 *   click event and trigger the browse event ourselves so we can show them the
 *   URL, so this is just extra protection.
 * - "allow-forms": NO.  We already sanitize forms out, so this is just extra
 *   protection.
 * - "allow-popups": NO.  We would never want this, but it also shouldn't be
 *   possible to even try to trigger this (scripts are disabled and sanitized,
 *   links are sanitized to forbid link targets as well as being nerfed), so
 *   this is also just extra protection.
 *
 * The spec makes a big deal that flag changes only take effect when navigation
 * occurs.  Accordingly, we may need to actually trigger navigation by using
 * a data URI (currently, and which should be able to inherit our origin)
 * rather than relying on about:blank.  On the other hand, sandbox flags have
 * been added to CSP, so we might also be able to rely on our CSP having set
 * things so that even the instantaneously created about:blank gets locked down.
 *
 * The only wrinkle right now is that gecko does not support the "seamless"
 * attribute.  This is not a problem since our content insertion is synchronous
 * and we can force a size calculation, but it would be nice if we didn't
 * have to do it.
 *
 * ## Document Width and Zooming ##
 *
 * There are two types of HTML e-mails:
 *
 * 1) E-mails written by humans which are basically unstructured prose plus
 *    quoting.  The biggest problems these face are deep quoting causing
 *    blockquote padding to cause text to have very little screen real estate.
 *
 * 2) Newsletter style e-mails which are structured and may have multiple
 *    columns, grids of images and stuff like that.
 *
 * Newsletters tend to assume a screen width of around 600px.  They also help
 * us out by usually explicitly sizing (parts) of themselves with that big
 * number, but usually a few levels of DOM in.  We could try and look for
 * explicit 'width' style directives (or attributes for tables), possibly
 * during sanitization, or we can try and force the layout engine to figure out
 * how wide the document really wants to be and then figure out if we need
 * a zoom strategy.  The latter approach is more reliable but will result in
 * layout having to perform 2 reflows (although one of them could probably be
 * run during synchronization and persisted).
 *
 * We use the make-layout-figure-it-out strategy and declare any width that
 * ended up being wider than the viewport's width is a newsletter.  We then
 * deal with the cases like so:
 *
 * 1) We force the iframe to be the width of our screen and try and imitate a
 *    seamless iframe by setting the height of the iframe to its scrollHeight.
 *
 * 2) We force the iframe to be the size it wants to be and use transform magic
 *    and gallery interaction logic to let the user pan and zoom to their
 *    heart's content.  We lack the ability to perform reflows-on-zoom like
 *    browser frames can do right now, so this sucks, but not as bad as if we
 *    tried to force the newsletter into a smaller width than it was designed
 *    for.  We could implement some workarounds for this, but it seems useful
 *    to try and drive this in platform.
 *
 * Here's an interesting blog post on font inflation for those that want to
 * know more:

 *
 * BUGS BLOCKING US FROM DOING WHAT WE REALLY WANT, MAYBE:
 *
 * - HTML5 iframe sandbox attribute which is landing soon.
 *   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=341604
 *
 * - reflow on zoom doesn't exist yet?
 *   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=710298
 *
 * BUGS MAKING US DO WORKAROUNDS:
 *
 * - iframe "seamless" doesn't work, so we manually need to poke stuff:
 *   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80713
 *
 * - iframes can't get the web browser pan-and-zoom stuff for free, so we
 *   use logic from the gallery app.
 *   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=775456
 *
 * ATTENTION: ALL KINDS OF CODE IS COPIED AND PASTED FROM THE GALLERY APP TO
 * GIVE US PINCH AND ZOOM.  IF YOU SEE CODE THAT SAYS PHOTO, THAT IS WHY.
 * ALSO, PHOTOS WILL REPLACE EMAIL AS THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.
