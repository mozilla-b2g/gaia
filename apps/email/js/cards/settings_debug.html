<!-- Secret developer debug page; for those in the know.  This page can only be
     reached by tapping 5 times on some whitespace on the main settings page.

     NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE

     This page is intentionally unlocalized.  There's a few reasons for this:
     - The intended users are Firefox OS developers for which English is
       currently a pre-requisite.
     - It allows us to change these settings without being particularly
       concerned about string freeze.
     - We don't have to worry about the localized strings not capturing the
       risk of enabling this logging.

     This raises the question: Should this be shipped in non-developer builds if
     we think it's not worth localizing?  Our current rationale is that it is
     useful.  We (the developers) have had bug reporters enable the logging and
     worked with us to fix bugs using the functionality.  Especially given our
     limited ability to provide updated versions of the app or have users
     side-load versions of our certified app.
