/**
 * Show a spinner in for two possible steps in the setup of an account:
 *
 * 1) During the autoconfig step, when figuring out the capabilities of the
 * server, and possibly needing an oauth jump.
 *
 * 2) During the manual config or password flow when finally connecting to the
 * service to confirm password and settings are correct.
 *
 * So the possible flows are:
 *
 * OAuth: setup_account_info -> setup_progress -> setup_account_prefs
 * autoconfig password: setup_account_info -> setup_progress ->
 *                      setup_password -> setup_progress -> setup_account_prefs
 * manual config: setup_account_info -> setup_manual_config ->
 *                setup_progress -> setup_account_prefs
