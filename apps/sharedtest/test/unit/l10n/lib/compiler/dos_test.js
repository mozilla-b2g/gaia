      ' CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole\\',

      ' Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on\\',
      ' the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped\\',
      ' into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\',
      ' conversations in it, \'and what is the use of a book,\' thought\\',
      ' Alice \'without pictures or conversation?\'\\',

      ' So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for\\',
      ' the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the\\',
      ' pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of\\',
      ' getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit\\',
      ' with pink eyes ran close by her.\\',

      ' There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think\\',
      ' it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,\\',
      ' \'Oh dear!  Oh dear! I shall be late!\' (when she thought it over\\',
      ' afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at\\',
      ' this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the\\',
      ' Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and\\',
      ' looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for\\',
      ' it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit\\',
      ' with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and\\',
      ' burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and\\',
      ' fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole\\',
      ' under the hedge.\\',

      ' In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering\\',
      ' how in the world she was to get out again.\\',

      ' The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and\\',
      ' then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment\\',
      ' to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling\\',
      ' down a very deep well.',
