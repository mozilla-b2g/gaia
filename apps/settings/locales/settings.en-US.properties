# hotspot-wpa2-psk= &#x202a;WPA2 (AES)&#x202c;
#
# [More details]

# Please check settings.ar.properties to see the difference first.
#
# We have to put "&#x202a;" and "&#x202c;" these two RTL related characters
# in Arabic locales to make sure these two strings would not be translated
# automatically in a wrong way by browser. Because from engineering side,
# we can only change settings.ar.properties, for localizers, please remember to
