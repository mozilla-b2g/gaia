# Settings
Settings app is a single place that
- Allows the user to configure device settings
- Responds to **incoming activities** ('configure'), which allows the user to navigate to a specific panel to configure from another app (eg. show the wifi settings panel if no data connection is available).

For new settings key that will be used in system, please do the key migration in `apps/system/js/migrators/settings_migrator.js`.

To change the default settings value, edit `build/config/common-settings.json` in gaia folder.


## Architecture

The settings app architecture is to ensure that each panel loads only the required scripts. Settings app breaks modules into smaller and reusable ones. Large scripts should also be splited into modules. By doing this we could achieve:

1. Module separation
2. Panel separation
3. Inline activities
4. View/logic separation

### Modules
We are using [AMD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) modules, loaded using 'Alemeda' (a lighter version of [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)) and building/optimizing using ['r.js'](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html) (the RequireJS optimizer). We have dependencies on files (`shared/js`) which aren't AMD modules. For those we use the ['shim'](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config-shim) options in our [`requirejs_config.js`](js/config/require.js)

Module should not aware the existence of any UI elements, it should only expose the general functionalities that used by panels.

A few fundamental modules are listed below:

#### module/settings_service.js
`SettingsService` provides a navigate function for panel navigation. It gets the corresponding panel module from `PanelCache` and call to its show and hide functions when navigating (see the module/panel.js section).

#### module/panel_cache.js
`PanelCache` loads panel modules based on panel IDs and caches the loaded modules. If there is no corresponding panel module, it returns `SettingsPanel`.

#### module/panel.js
`Panel` is the base object of the panels in settings app. It defines six basic functions: show, hide, beforeShow, beforeHide, init, and uninit. These functions are called by `SettingsService` during the navigation.
- init:       called at the first time when the beforeShow function gets called
- uninit:     called when cleanup
- beforeShow: called when the panel is about to be navigated into the viewport
- beforeHide: called when the panel is about to be navigated out of the viewport
- show:       called when the panel is navigated into the viewport
- hide:       called when the panel is navigated out of the viewport

The internal functions, `_onInit`, `_onBeforeShow`, `_onShow`, `_onBeforeHide`, `_onHide`, and `_onUninit`, are called respectively in the basic functions. The syntax of the functions are:

```js
function _onInit(panelElement [, initOptions])
function _onBeforeShow(panelElement [, beforeShowOptions])
function _onShow(panelElement [, showOptions])
function _onBeforeHide()
function _onHide()
function _onUninit()
```

We are able to override the internal functions by passing an option object into the constructor of `Panel`. For example,

```js
Panel({
  onInit: function(panelElement, initOptions) { //... },
  onBeforeShow: function(panelElement, beforeShowOptions) { //... },
  onShow: function(panelElement, showOptions) { //... },
  onBeforeHide: function() { //... },
  onHide: function() { //... },
  onUninit: function() { //... }
})
```

Typically we can create DOM element references in `onInit`, update UI elements and add listeners in `onShow` or `onBeforeShow`, remove listeners in `onHide`, and do the cleanup in `onUninit`. The difference between `onShow` and `onBeforeShow` is that `onBeforeShow` is called before the transition, which makes updating the UI before displaying it to users possible.

Note that the transition happens right after `onBeforeShow`, please avoid heavy things in `onBeforeShow` and `onBeforeHide`, or it may drag down the performance of the transition.

## module/settings_panel.js
`SettingsPanel` extends `Panel` with basic settings services. It presets the UI elements based on the values in mozSettings and add listeners responding to mozSettings changes in onBeforeShow. In `onInit` it parses the panel element for activating links. It also removes listeners in onHide so that we can avoid unwanted UI updates when the panel is outside of the viewport.

As we are using `require.js` for module management, scripts used in a panel should be wrapped in an AMD module or loaded from it, and which should extends from `SettingsPanel` to have basic settings services. Similar to `Panel`, we are able override `onShow`, `onHide`, `onBeforeShow`, `onBeforeHide`, `onInit`, and `onUninit` by passing an option object to the constructor of `SettingsPanel`.


## Implementation Guide
### How to create a new panel in Settings?
#### 1. Create an HTML template
Create the template with the following format and place it under `elements/`.

```html
<element name="{panel_name}" extends="section">
  <template>
    <!-- UI elements -->
  </template>
</element>
```

#### 2. Import the HTML template to index.html
Add the following `link` tag to the head element of index.html.

```html
<link rel="import" href="{path_to_html_template}">
```

#### 3. Create the placeholder for populating the HTML template
Add the following `section` tag in the body element of index.html. Typically `panel_id` and `panel_name` is identical.

```html
<section is="{panel_name}" role="region" id="{panel_id}"></section>
```


### How to load scripts for a panel?
#### 1. Define an AMD module for the panel
All dependent scripts should be loaded following the AMD pattern. Usually a panel module is extended from `SettingsPanel` to have the ability of automatic binding to the settings database. You can choose to extend from `Panel` if you would like to handing the binding by yourself or the panel does not need the database at all. Require other depedent modules in the modeul definition. A simple module looks like:

```js
define(function(require) { // use this exact syntax, or the r.js compiler might not work well
  var SettingsPanel = require('modules/SettingsPanel');
  var Module1 = require('modules/Module1');
  var Module2 = require('modules/Module2');

  return SettingsPanel({
    onInit: function(rootElement, initOptions) {
      // ...
    },
    onUninit: function() {
      // ...
    },
    onShow: function(rootElement, showOptions) {
      // ...
    },
    onHide: function() {
      // ...
    }
  });
});
```

#### 2. Add the module to the HTML template
A panel module could be loaded by adding a <panel> tag with a `data-path` attrbute specifying the panel module in the end of the template. The template will look like:

```html
<element name="{panel_name}" extends="section">
  <template>
    <!-- UI elements -->
    <panel data-path="{path_to_panel_module}"></panel>
  </template>
</element>
```

Note that there should be only one panel module specified in the template. All other dependent modules should be required in the panel module. `SettingsPanel` is used by default if no panel module is specified.

All panels should be defined in the folder under `panels/` with the name identical to the panel's name. ex: battery panel should be defined in `panels/battery` folder.

Before set review for a new panel, you MUST use `reset-gaia` instead of `install-gaia` to check if it works after `r.js` compiles panel modules into a single file. Some shared modules should be excluded in `settings/js/config/require.js`.


###How to port an existing panel to follow the new architecture design?
Basically this could be done by following the previous two sections. Create a panel module and require the dependent modules converted from the original scripts, then add the panel module to the HTML template. Details are explained in the following.

#### 1. Create a new panel module
Follow this [section](#how-to-create-a-new-panel-in-settings) to create a new panel module and add it to the corresponding HTML template that could be found under `elements/`. The panel module must be placed under `panels/<panel_name>/` and named as `panel.js`. Remember to remove all script tags in the template because they should be required in the panel module.

#### 2. Convert original scripts to AMD modules
Examine all dependent scripts carefully and convert them to reusable modules. Reusable means that the modules should not be bound to fixed UI elements so that we have the flexibility doing the binding dynamically. It also implies that the unit tests no longer depend on UI elements, which makes writing tests more easily.

#### 3. Load the modules in the panel module
The panel module created in the first step is the start point of each panel and it should be responsible for loading all dependent modules. Note that we should use [sugared syntax](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#sugar) when loading the modules and avoid naming the module explicitly.

#### 4. Configure module settings
Settings app utilizes `r.js` in the build process. It produces module scripts based on the configuration file, `settings/js/config/require.js`. The following object in the `modules` array in the configuration file specifies a module:

```js
{
  name: '{path_to_panel_module}',
  exclude: ['main']
}
```

All dependent modules of the specified module except for the modules listed in the exclude array will be merged into one file in the build process. This allows that all code required code could be loaded at once when a panel is navigated.

#### 5. Run integration tests
Run the tests with the following command to ensure the refactoring does not break the anything.

```
$ make test-integration APP=settings
```

## Build Steps
Settings app has it's own [`Makefile`](Makefile). A Makefile is similar to Grunt, but written in bash. It is essentially a list of tasks that can be run (via `make <task-name>`). When a Gaia application has its own `apps/<app-name>/Makefile`, it will be automatically run when Gaia builds.

Our `Makefile` has two tasks, one to **'build'** and one to **'clean'** (delete the build). The build steps are as follows:

1. Remove any previous settings build from the `build_stage/`
2. Create an new directory `build_stage/settings`
3. Run the `r.js` (RequireJS optimizer), pointing it at our `require_config.jslike` file (`.jslike` because we don't want Gaia builds to mess with it [I think]). This copies our entire application (JS and all) and bundles our JS (tracing `require()` calls) and CSS (tracing `@import`) in two single files.

## Q&A

### How to make sure some specific works are done before rendering panels ?

Sometimes, you may need to do something before rendering panels. In order to achieve this, you have to return a promise object in `onBeforeShow` first and Settings app will do the transition after the promise is resolved. By the way, don't put some really heavy works here, otherwise users will feel confused and would treat Settings app as broken.

```js
return SettingsPanel({
  onBeforeShow: function _onBeforeShow() {
    var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      // do your works here
      // then call the resolve method from Promise instance
      fetch_data_from_server(function callback() {
        resolve();
      });
    });

    // Return the promise object back to Settings app
    return promise;
  }
});
```

### How to define dialogs in settings?

Please use `DialogService` in settings for dialogs. `DialogService` maintain dialog style between different form factors, handles transition, show/hide * dialogs, and provide promise style callbacks.

### How to deal with CSS that compatible with RTL?

In short, please don't use left/right in CSS, use -start/-end instead.
