<h3 id="license-grants-and-conditions">2. License Grants and Conditions</h3>
<h4 id="grants">2.1. Grants</h4>
<p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and</p></li>
<li><p>under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="effective-date">2.2. Effective Date</h4>
<p>The licenses granted in Section&nbsp;2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.</p>
<h4 id="limitations-on-grant-scope">2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</h4>
<p>The licenses granted in this Section&nbsp;2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section&nbsp;2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or</p></li>
<li><p>for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or</p></li>
<li><p>under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section&nbsp;3.4).</p>
<h4 id="subsequent-licenses">2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h4>
<p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section&nbsp;10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section&nbsp;3.3).</p>
<h4 id="representation">2.5. Representation</h4>
<p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>
<h4 id="fair-use">2.6. Fair Use</h4>
<p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.</p>
<h4 id="conditions">2.7. Conditions</h4>
<p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section&nbsp;2.1.</p>
<h3 id="responsibilities">3. Responsibilities</h3>
<h4 id="distribution-of-source-form">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h4>
<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.</p>
<h4 id="distribution-of-executable-form">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</h4>
<p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section&nbsp;3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p></li>
<li><p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="distribution-of-a-larger-work">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h4>
<p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>
<h4 id="notices">3.4. Notices</h4>
<p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
<h4 id="application-of-additional-terms">3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h4>
<p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</p>
<h3 id="inability-to-comply-due-to-statute-or-regulation">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h3>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
<h3 id="termination">5. Termination</h3>
<p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section&nbsp;2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
<p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections&nbsp;5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer-of-warranty">6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
<p><em>Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.</em></p>
<h3 id="limitation-of-liability">7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p><em>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</em></p>
<h3 id="litigation">8. Litigation</h3>
<p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous">9. Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>
<h3 id="versions-of-the-license">10. Versions of the License</h3>
<h4 id="new-versions">10.1. New Versions</h4>
<p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section&nbsp;10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.</p>
<h4 id="effect-of-new-versions">10.2. Effect of New Versions</h4>
<p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.</p>
<h4 id="modified-versions">10.3. Modified Versions</h4>
<p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).</p>
<h4 id="distributing-source-code-form-that-is-incompatible-with-secondary-licenses">10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses</h4>
<p>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p>
<h3 id="exhibit-a---source-code-form-license-notice">Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice</h3>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
</pre>

<h3><a id="SEC2">Preamble</a></h3>

<p>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
</p>
<p>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
</p>
<p>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
</p>
<p>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
</p>
<p>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
</p>
<p>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
</p>
<p>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
</p>
<p>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
</p>
<p>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.
</p>
<p>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
</p>
<p>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
</p>
<p>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
</p>
<p>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
</p>

<h3><a id="SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></h3>


<p>
<strong>0.</strong>
This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</p>
<p>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
</p>
<p>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
</p>
<p>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
</p>
<p>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
</p>
<p>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>a)</strong>
       The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>
  <li><strong>b)</strong>
       You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>

  <li><strong>c)</strong>
       You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>

  <li><strong>d)</strong>
       If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.
       <p>
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</p>
<p>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
based on the Library.
</p>
<p>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.</strong>
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
</p>
<p>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
</p>
<p>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.</strong>
You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
</p>
<p>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.</strong>
A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
</p>
<p>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
</p>
<p>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
</p>
<p>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.</strong>
As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
</p>
<p>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete
    corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
    including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
    distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
    executable linked with the Library, with the complete
    machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
    and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
    then relink to produce a modified executable containing the
    modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the
    contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
    be able to recompile the application to use the modified
    definitions.)</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism
    for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that
    (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
    user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into
    the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
    version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
    modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
    work was made with.</li>

    <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,
    valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
    materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.</li>

    <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by
    offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent
    access to copy the above specified materials from the same
    place.</li>

    <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received
    a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user
    a copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
</p>
<p>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
</p>
<p>
<strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy
    of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
    library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of
    the Sections above.</li>

    <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined
    library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
    Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
    form of the same work.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.</strong>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>10.</strong>
Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>11.</strong>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
</p>
<p>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
</p>
<p>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</p>
<p>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>12.</strong>
If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
</p>
<p>
<strong>13.</strong>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
</p>
<p>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>14.</strong>
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
</p>
<p>
<strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>15.</strong>
BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>
<p>
<strong>16.</strong>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

        <h2>GNU General Public License 2.0</h2>
        <pre>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

<h3><a id="preamble"></a><a id="gpl-SEC2">Preamble</a></h3>

<p>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</p>

<p>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</p>

<p>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</p>

<p>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</p>

<p>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</p>

<p>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</p>


<h3><a id="terms"></a><a id="gpl-SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></h3>


<a id="section0"></a><p>
<strong>0.</strong>
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</p>

<p>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</p>

<a id="section1"></a><p>
<strong>1.</strong>
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
</p>

<p>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</p>

<a id="section2"></a><p>
<strong>2.</strong>
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>a)</strong>
      You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    </dd>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>b)</strong>
      You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.
    </dd>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>c)</strong>
      If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</p>

<p>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</p>

<p>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</p>

<a id="section3"></a><p>
<strong>3.</strong>
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
</p>

<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>a)</strong>
      Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    </dd>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>b)</strong>
      Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
    </dd>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>c)</strong>
      Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</p>

<p>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</p>

<a id="section4"></a><p>
<strong>4.</strong>
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</p>

<a id="section5"></a><p>
<strong>5.</strong>
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
</p>

<a id="section6"></a><p>
<strong>6.</strong>
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
</p>

<a id="section7"></a><p>
<strong>7.</strong>
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
</p>

<p>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</p>

<p>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</p>

<a id="section8"></a><p>
<strong>8.</strong>
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
</p>

<a id="section9"></a><p>
<strong>9.</strong>
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
</p>

<p>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</p>

<a id="section10"></a><p>
<strong>10.</strong>
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
</p>

<a id="section11"></a><p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>11.</strong>
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>

<a id="section12"></a><p>
<strong>12.</strong>
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        <h2>Eclipse Public License 1.0</h2>
          <p class="c2">1. DEFINITIONS</p>

  <p>"Contribution" means:</p>

  <blockquote>
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br>
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br>
    i) changes to the Program, and<br>
    ii) additions to the Program;
  </blockquote>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
  from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
  'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
  Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
  Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
  separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
  under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the
  Program.

  <p>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the
  Program.</p>

  <p>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
  are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or
  when combined with the Program.</p>

  <p>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
  Agreement.</p>

  <p>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
  including all Contributors.</p>

  <p class="c2">2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p>

  <blockquote>
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
    perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
    if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code
    form.<br>
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
    Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
    transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
    object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
    the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
    added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
    shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
    No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br>
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent
    or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
    otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
    hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
    any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
    third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute
    the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
    before distributing the Program.<br>
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
    license set forth in this Agreement.
  </blockquote>

  <p class="c2">3. REQUIREMENTS</p>

  <p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
  under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br>
    b) its license agreement:<br>
    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
    conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
    title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
    merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br>
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
    damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br>
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
    offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br>
    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
  </blockquote>

  <p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>

  <blockquote>
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br>
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
    Program.
  </blockquote>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices
  contained within the Program.

  <p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
  Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
  Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>

  <p class="c2">4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p>

  <p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
  with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
  license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
  Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
  should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
  other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
  commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
  hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
  Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses")
  arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
  party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
  or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
  distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
  obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating
  to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to
  qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
  Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in,
  the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
  Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p>

  <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,
  or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
  warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under
  this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
  against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
  warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
  damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</p>

  <p class="c2">5. NO WARRANTY</p>

  <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
  ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
  CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
  the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
  risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement ,
  including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
  compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
  equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p>

  <p class="c2">6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p>

  <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
  ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
  INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
  LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
  WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
  OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
  OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

  <p class="c2">7. GENERAL</p>

  <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
  remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
  parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
  necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

  <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
  a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
  itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
  hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
  rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
  litigation is filed.</p>

  <p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
  to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
  and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
  becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this
  Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
  Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations
  under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the
  Program shall continue and survive.</p>

  <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
  but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
  only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
  the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
  from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to
  modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
  Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as
  the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
  the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
  (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version
  of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new
  version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute
  the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
  expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
  rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
  this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
  All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are
  reserved.</p>

  <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
  intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
  this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one
  year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a
  jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

                   version before using

such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by
Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
infringed by this implementation of VP8. This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this
implementation. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order
or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that this
implementation of VP8 or any code incorporated within this implementation of
VP8 constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of
patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
for this implementation of VP8 shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.        </pre>

System Device Controller Microprocessor Firmware Theory of Operation
     for Part Number 1820-4784 Revision B.  Dwg No. A-1820-4784-2
Helge Deller's original hilkbd.c port for PA-RISC.<br><br>Driver theory of operation:<br><br>hp_sdc_put does all writing to the SDC.  ISR can run on a different
CPU than hp_sdc_put, but only one CPU runs hp_sdc_put at a time
(it cannot really benefit from SMP anyway.)  A tasket fit this perfectly.<br><br>All data coming back from the SDC is sent via interrupt and can be read
fully in the ISR, so there are no latency/throughput problems there.
The problem is with output, due to the slow clock speed of the SDC
compared to the CPU.  This should not be too horrible most of the time,
but if used with HIL devices that support the multibyte transfer command,
keeping outbound throughput flowing at the 6500KBps that the HIL is
capable of is more than can be done at HZ=100.<br><br>Busy polling for IBF clear wastes CPU cycles and bus cycles.  hp_sdc.ibf
is set to 0 when the IBF flag in the status register has cleared.  ISR
may do this, and may also access the parts of queued transactions related
to reading data back from the SDC, but otherwise will not touch the
hp_sdc state. Whenever a register is written hp_sdc.ibf is set to 1.<br><br>The i8042 write index and the values in the 4-byte input buffer
starting at 0x70 are kept track of in hp_sdc.wi, and .r7[], respectively,
to minimize the amount of IO needed to the SDC.  However these values
do not need to be locked since they are only ever accessed by hp_sdc_put.<br><br>A timer task schedules the tasklet once per second just to make
sure it doesn't freeze up and to allow for bad reads to time out.

HP-HIL Technical Reference Manual.  Hewlett Packard Product No. 45918A<br><br>Driver theory of operation:<br><br>Some access methods and an ISR is defined by the sub-driver
(e.g. hp_sdc_mlc.c).  These methods are expected to provide a
few bits of logic in addition to raw access to the HIL MLC,
specifically, the ISR, which is entirely registered by the
sub-driver and invoked directly, must check for record
termination or packet match, at which point a semaphore must
be cleared and then the hil_mlcs_tasklet must be scheduled.<br><br>The hil_mlcs_tasklet processes the state machine for all MLCs
each time it runs, checking each MLC's progress at the current
node in the state machine, and moving the MLC to subsequent nodes
in the state machine when appropriate.  It will reschedule
itself if output is pending.  (This rescheduling should be replaced
at some point with a sub-driver-specific mechanism.)<br><br>A timer task prods the tasklet once per second to prevent
hangups when attached devices do not return expected data
and to initiate probes of the loop for new devices.

        <pre>This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.<br><br>This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL<br><br> -----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br><br> -----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.<br><br>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br><br>DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.<br><br>"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).<br><br>"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<br><br>"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.<br><br>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.<br><br>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.<br><br>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br><br>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.<br><br>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.<br><br>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.<br><br>TERMINATION

not met.<br><br>DISCLAIMER
