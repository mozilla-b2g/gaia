## Auto time zone update protocol support

We have different SIM card support by carrier

* For SIM card from carriers supporting auto time zone update(ex: CHT), the timezone is grayed out when you turn on "set automatically".
* For SIM card from carriers not supporting auto time zone update(ex: Taiwan mobile), the time zone should not be grayed out when you turn on "set automatically".
