## Auto time zone update protocol support

We have different SIM card support by carrier

* For SIM card from carriers(ex: CHT) supporting the auto time zone update protocol(NITZ), the timezone is grayed out when you turn on "set automatically".
* For SIM card from carriers(ex: Taiwan mobile) not supporting auto time zone update, the time zone selection field should not be grayed out when you turn on "set automatically".
