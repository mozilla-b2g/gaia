Many of the word lists in this directory are open-source files from
the Android source code. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME/+/master/dictionaries/

The Catal√† wordlist (ca_wordlist.xml) was generated by Professor Kevin
Scannell of Saint Louis University http://borel.slu.edu/

The xml2dict.py script in this directory converts the wordlists into
the FirefoxOS binary dictionary format. These wordlists are not part
of the FirefoxOS build, but the binary dictionaries in
../apps/keyboard/js/imes/latin/dictionaries/ are.
